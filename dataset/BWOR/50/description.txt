5.12 There are four individuals — X, Y, Z, and R — and five tasks A, B, C, D, and F. The time (in unspecified units) each person needs to complete each task is shown in Table 5-3. Since there are more tasks than people, the following assignment conditions are considered:(a) One person may take on two tasks, while the other three people each handle one. (b) Either X or Z must take on two tasks, and Y and R each take one. (c) Each person completes one task, but tasks A and B must be completed, while one among C, D, or F may be left unassigned. Objective: For each scenario (a), (b), and (c), determine the assignment plan that results in the minimum total completion time.
