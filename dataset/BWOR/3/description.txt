 At the beginning of the year, Hongdou Garment Factory launched a new fashion product. Based on experience and market research, the predicted demand for this product over the next six months is as follows: 
 January:3,000 units, February:3,600 units, March:4,000 units, April: 4,600 units, May:4,800 units, June:5,000 units 
 Each unit requires 4 hours of skilled labor and 150 dollars worth of raw materials to produce. The selling price is 240 dollars per unit. 
 At the beginning of January, the factory has 80 skilled workers, each working 160 hours per month. To meet production needs, the factory can recruit and train new workers. Training a new worker takes 50 hours of a skilled worker’s time for instruction, and the training period lasts one month, after which the trainee can become a skilled worker. Skilled workers are paid 2,000 dollars per month. Trainees receive a living allowance of 800 dollars during the training month. After completing training, new workers receive the same salary and work efficiency as skilled workers. Each month, 2\% of skilled workers (including those newly trained and on the job for at least one month) leave due to various reasons. 
 The factory starts the year with 400 units of inventory and requires that the ending inventory in June not exceed 100 units. Additionally, if garments are not delivered in the month of production, they incur a storage cost of 10 dollars per unit per month. Design a labor and production plan for the factory that satisfies the monthly and end-of-June inventory requirements, while maximizing the total revenue from January to June.
