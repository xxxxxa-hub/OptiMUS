    \noindent\textbf{3.8} A company has signed a delivery contract with a customer for equipment. The quarterly production capacity, production cost per unit, and delivery quantity at the end of each quarter are shown in Table 3-30. If equipment produced in one quarter is not delivered during that quarter, a storage and maintenance fee of 0.1 thousand yuan per unit per quarter is incurred. Question: Under the condition of meeting the delivery contract, how should the company arrange its production schedule throughout the year to minimize the total annual cost(in thousand yuan)?
