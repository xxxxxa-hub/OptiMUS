 A cargo ship has three compartments: front, middle, and rear. Their volumes and maximum allowable loads are shown in \ref{table1-24}. 
 There are three types of cargo to be shipped, with data shown in  \ref{table1-25}.

        A & 600 & 10 & 8 & 1000 \\
        \hline
        B & 1000 & 5 & 6 & 700 \\

 For maritime safety, the actual load weight in the front, middle, and rear compartments must maintain roughly the same proportion as their respective maximum allowable loads. 
 Specifically: The load weight ratios between the front/middle and rear/middle compartments must not deviate by more than 15\% from the ratios of their respective max allowable loads. The ratio between front and rear compartments must not deviate by more than 10\%. 
 Question: How many pieces of cargo A, B, and C should be loaded in total to maximize revenue, while meeting the volume, weight, and balance constraints? 
 Please formulate the linear programming model for this problem.
