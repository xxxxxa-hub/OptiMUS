  The delivery tasks of a certain T Factory are shown in Table 7-5. The numbers in the table represent the delivery quantities at the end of each month. The factory’s production capacity is 400 units per month, and the warehouse storage capacity is 300 units. It is known that the production cost for every 100 units is 10,000 yuan. In any month that production takes place, the factory must pay fixed operating expenses of 4,000 yuan. The warehouse storage cost is 1,000 yuan per 100 units per month. It is assumed that there is no inventory at the beginning and none remaining after the final delivery at the end of June. Question: How many units should be produced in each month so that the delivery requirements are met and the total cost is minimized?
