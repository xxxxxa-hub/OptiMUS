  There are two types of resources. The first resource has x units, and the second resource has y units, to be allocated to n departments. The profit obtained by allocating x_i units of the first resource and y_i units of the second resource to department i is denoted as r_i(x, y). Suppose x = 3, y = 3, and n = 3, and the profits r_i(x, y) are listed in Table 7-3 below.Question: How should these two resources be allocated to the i departments to maximize total profit?
