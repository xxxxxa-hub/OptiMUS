5.25 A master’s student majoring in Operations Research at a university is required to choose from the following seven courses: Calculus, Operations Research, Data Structures, Managerial Statistics, Computer Simulation, Computer Programming, and Forecasting. Among these, the student must select two Mathematics courses, two Operations Research courses, and two Computer Science courses. Some courses belong to only one category: Calculus is a Mathematics course, and Computer Programming is a Computer Science course. However, some courses span multiple categories: Operations Research counts as both Operations Research and Mathematics; Data Structures belong to both Computer Science and Mathematics; Managerial Statistics belong to both Mathematics and Operations Research; Computer Simulation belongs to both Computer Science and Operations Research; Forecasting belongs to both Operations Research and Mathematics. If a course falls into two categories, selecting it counts as one course in each of those two categories.In addition, some courses have prerequisites: to take Computer Simulation or Data Structures, one must first take Computer Programming; to take Managerial Statistics, one must first take Calculus; and to take Forecasting, one must first take Managerial Statistics.Question: What is the minimum number of courses a master’s student must take, and which courses must be taken, in order to meet the above requirements?
