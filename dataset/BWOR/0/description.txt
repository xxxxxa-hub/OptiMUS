    A candy factory uses raw materials A, B, and C to produce three different brands of candy: Brand X, Brand Y, and Brand Z. The content proportions of A, B, and C in each brand, the costs of the raw materials, the monthly usage limits for each raw material, as well as the unit processing cost and selling price of each candy brand are shown in Table 1-17.The question is: How many kilograms of each brand of candy should the factory produce each month in order to maximize its profit?Please formulate a linear programming mathematical model for this problem.
