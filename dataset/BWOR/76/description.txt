  An assembly line has 5 stations, each responsible for one of the five steps in the assembly of a certain product. Five workers — A, B, C, D, and E — are to be assigned to operate these stations. Due to differences in individual skills, the production efficiency of each worker varies by station. The specific efficiencies are shown in Table 8-10 (unit: pieces/min). Question: How should each worker be assigned to a station to maximize the overall production capacity of the assembly line?
