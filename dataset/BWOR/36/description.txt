1.45 A company has three tasks that require the recruitment of skilled workers (technicians) and unskilled workers (laborers) to complete. Task 1 can be completed either by one technician alone, or by a team consisting of one technician and two laborers. Task 2 can be completed by either one technician or one laborer alone.Task 3 can be completed either by a team of five laborers, or by a team consisting of one technician leading three laborers. It is known that: The weekly wage is 100 yuan for each technician, and 80 yuan for each laborer. Each person works 48 hours per week, but their effective working time per week is: Technician: 42 hours, Laborer: 36 hours, To complete the three tasks, the total effective working time required per week is: Task 1: 10,000 hours, Task 2: 20,000 hours, Task 3: 30,000 hours. The number of workers that can be recruited is no more than 400 technicians and 800 laborers. Problem: Formulate a mathematical model to determine how many technicians and laborers should be recruited, so that the total wage cost is minimized.
