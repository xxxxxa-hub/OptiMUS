    Jinyuan Company produces three types of products over a planning period divided into three stages. A production plan needs to be formulated to determine the quantity of each product to be produced at each stage.
 The plan is constrained by market demand, equipment working hours, and financial capital. Relevant data are shown in Table 4-16 and Table 4-17. It is assumed that the initial and final inventories of all products are zero.

The company sets the following three prioritized objectives: 1.Timely delivery to meet demand, minimizing stockouts. The importance of timely delivery for Product 3 is twice that of Products 1 and 2. 2.Minimize overloading of processing equipment at each stage. 3.Ensure that working capital usage does not exceed the limit.Please formulate a mathematical model and optimize it accordingly.
