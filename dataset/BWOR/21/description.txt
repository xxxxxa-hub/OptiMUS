    To ensure the normal operation of a certain piece of equipment, it is necessary to determine the number of spare parts for three different components $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$, which work in series. Increasing the number of spare parts can improve the equipment’s operational reliability but also increases the cost. The total investment is limited to 8 thousand yuan.The relationship between the number of spare parts, their reliability, and their cost is shown in Table 7-19. Determine how many spare parts should be allocated for each of $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ to maximize the equipment’s operational reliability (i.e., maximize the sum of the logarithms of the component reliabilities).
Formulate and solve the mathematical model.
