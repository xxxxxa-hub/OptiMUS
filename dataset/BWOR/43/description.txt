3.13 In the transportation problem shown in Table 3-17, if one unit of goods from origin i is not shipped, a storage cost will be incurred. Assume that the unit storage costs at origins 1, 2, and 3 are 5, 4, and 3, respectively. Also, it is assumed that at least 38 units must be shipped from origin 2 and at least 27 units from origin 3. Solve for the optimal solution to this transportation problem.
