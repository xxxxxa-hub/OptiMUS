  A certain machine can operate continuously for 4 years, or it can be sold at the end of any year and replaced with a new one. The purchase price of a new machine at the beginning of each year and the salvage value at the end of various service lifespans are shown in Table 8-7.In addition: The operating and maintenance cost for a new machine in its first year is 0.3 thousand yuan.For machines used for 1 to 3 years, the annual operating and maintenance costs are 0.8, 1.5, and 2.0 thousand yuan, respectively.
