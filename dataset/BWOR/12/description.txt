Forecasted return on investment (ROI) for each product is: Product A: 5%, Product B: 7%, Product C: 10%, Due to associated risks, the company has defined the following priority constraints: 1.At least 300 thousand yuan must be invested in Product A. 2.To diversify investment risk, no single product may receive more than 35% of the total fund. 3.At least 10% of the fund (i.e., 1 million yuan) must be reserved for emergency use.4.The objective is to maximize total profit from the investment.
