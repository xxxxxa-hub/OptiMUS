    It is known that the vitamin and cholesterol content per unit of milk, beef, and eggs are shown in Table 4-15. Considering only these three foods, the following three goals are set:1.Meet the minimum daily requirement for three types of vitamins. 2.Minimize daily cholesterol intake. 3.Minimize daily food cost. The task is to formulate a goal programming model for this problem.
