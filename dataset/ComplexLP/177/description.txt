A company produces and sells two different products. The demand for each product is unlimited, but the company is constrained by cash availability and machine capacity. Each unit of the first and second product requires 3 and 4 machine hours, respectively. There are 20,000 machine hours available in the current production period. The production costs are $3 and $2 per unit of the first and second product, respectively. The selling prices of the first and second product are $6 and $5.40 per unit, respectively. The available cash is $4,000; furthermore, 45% of the sales revenues from the first product and 30% of the sales revenues from the product will be made available to finance operations during the current period. Suppose that the company could increase its available machine hours by 2,000, after spending $400 for certain repairs.Formulate a linear programming problem and find the maximum net income subject to the cash availability and machine capacity limitations. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
