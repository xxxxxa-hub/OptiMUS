Imagine you're overseeing the distribution of medical supplies across five different regions to ensure everyone has access to the resources they need. Each region currently has a certain quantity of supplies, but the demand varies from region to region.

Here's the breakdown of the current supplies and the required quantities for each region:

- Region 1 currently has 133 units but needs 146 units.
- Region 2 currently has 189 units but needs 270 units.
- Region 3 currently has 446 units but needs 313 units.
- Region 4 currently has 346 units but needs 102 units.
- Region 5 currently has 184 units but needs 412 units.

You have the ability to redistribute supplies from one region to another, but there are transportation costs associated with this.

Here's a cost matrix showing how much it costs to transport supplies between each pair of regions:

- Transporting supplies from/to Region 1: To Region 2 costs 24, to Region 3 costs 32, to Region 4 costs 44, to Region 5 costs 46.
- Transporting supplies from/to Region 2: To Region 1 costs 41, to Region 3 costs 6, to Region 4 costs 11, to Region 5 costs 49.
- Transporting supplies from/to Region 3: To Region 1 costs 40, to Region 2 costs 10, to Region 4 costs 40, to Region 5 costs 45.
- Transporting supplies from/to Region 4: To Region 1 costs 22, to Region 2 costs 22, to Region 3 costs 34, to Region 5 costs 1.
- Transporting supplies from/to Region 5: To Region 1 costs 46, to Region 2 costs 14, to Region 3 costs 35, to Region 4 costs 36.

Your objective is to ensure that every region receives the necessary supplies while minimizing transportation costs. What would be the minimum cost to meet the demand for medical supplies in all regions?
