One unit of fruit salad A requires 1/4 of a mango, 1/8 of a pineapple, and 3 strawberries, with a net profit of 10 RMB. Making one unit of fruit salad B requires 1/2 a mango, 1/4 of a pineapple, and 1 strawberry, with a net profit of 20 RMB. The stock/resources row shows that there are 25 mangos, 10 pineapples, and 120 strawberries available for making these fruit salads. Suppose all fruits need to be processed and completely used to make the fruit salads A and B. All fruits must satisfy the constraint of having at most 5 units left or 5 additional units used. Find the maximal total profits of the fruit store. Note: Since we want to produce “complete fruit salads”, the variables x1 and x2 should actually be modeled as integer variables: x1, x2 ∈ Z.
