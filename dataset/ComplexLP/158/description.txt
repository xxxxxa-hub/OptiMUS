In the bustling world of retail and distribution, a major company, GlobalSupply, is facing a strategic challenge. It needs to efficiently supply its products to eight different retail stores, each with its own demand for goods. To achieve this, GlobalSupply is considering opening up to eight different distribution centers, but each center comes with its own set of opening costs and has a specific capacity limit. Additionally, the cost of transporting goods from these distribution centers to the retail stores varies, adding another layer of complexity to the decision-making process. GlobalSupply's primary objective is to fulfill the demand at each retail store while minimizing the total cost, which includes both the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of the goods.
