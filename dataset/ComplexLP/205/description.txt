A post office requires different numbers of full-time employees on different days of the week. The number of full-time employees required on each day is given in Table 4. Monday requires 17 employees,Tuesday requires13, Wednesday requires 15, Thursday requires 19, Friday requires 14, Saturday requires 16,  Sunday requires 11. Union rules state that each full-time employee must work five consecutive days and then receive two days off. For example, an employee who works Monday to Friday must be off on Saturday and Sunday. The post office wants to meet its daily requirements using only fulltime employees. Formulate an LP that the post office can use to minimize the number of full-time employees who must be hired. Find the minimal number.
