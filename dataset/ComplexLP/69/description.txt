In a scenario that mirrors the challenges faced by a global logistics company, imagine that there is a need to send a single shipment to six different regional distribution centers. These centers are located in various cities, identified by the numbers 1 to 6. The shipment must be delivered to each center exactly once before returning to the city of origin, and the objective is to minimize the total cost of travel between these cities.

The costs associated with travel between the centers are encapsulated in a cost matrix, which represents the diverse expenses of logistics, such as fuel, labor, tolls, and fees associated with each route. For instance, moving the shipment from City 1 to City 2 incurs a cost of 83 monetary units, whereas transporting it from City 1 to City 3 costs only 30 units. Each pair of cities has a unique cost associated with the travel between them, with no possibility of avoiding a cost when moving from a city to itself.

Here is a breakdown of some specific travel costs between the cities:
- The cost to move the shipment from City 1 to City 4 is 38 units.
- From City 2, it costs 13 units to deliver to City 4 but 93 units to deliver to City 3.
- The shipment can be moved from City 3 to City 5 at a low cost of 17 units, whereas traveling from City 3 to City 4 is notably more expensive at 85 units.
- Traveling from City 5 to City 2 costs 42 units, yet the cost increases to 87 units when the shipment has to be delivered from City 5 back to City 1.

Given the complexity of the routes and the varying costs, the logistical challenge is to determine the sequence of deliveries that will result in the lowest total cost for transporting the shipment to all six regional distribution centers and then returning it to the starting city.

What is the minimum total travel cost for completing this delivery circuit, visiting each city exactly once and then returning to the city of origin?
