In the bustling metropolis of FlowCity, the local government has embarked on an ambitious project to revamp its old water distribution network, which connects 9 critical reservoirs across the city. This network, vital for the city's water supply, is designed to maximize the efficiency of water flow from the primary reservoir to a central distribution hub.

Here's a detailed look at the current capacities of the pipelines (measured in millions of gallons per day) that link these reservoirs:

- From Reservoir 0 (Source): Water can flow to Reservoir 1 (6), Reservoir 2 (16), Reservoir 3 (12), Reservoir 4 (16), Reservoir 5 (3), Reservoir 6 (9), Reservoir 7 (3), and Reservoir 8 (13).
- From Reservoir 1: Water can be distributed to Reservoir 0 (2), Reservoir 3 (20), Reservoir 4 (13), Reservoir 5 (7), Reservoir 6 (20), Reservoir 7 (11), and Reservoir 8 (13).
- From Reservoir 2: Water can flow to Reservoir 0 (4), Reservoir 1 (15), Reservoir 3 (14), Reservoir 4 (13), Reservoir 5 (5), Reservoir 6 (12), Reservoir 7 (14), and Reservoir 8 (16).
- From Reservoir 3: Water can be distributed to Reservoir 0 (1), Reservoir 2 (2), Reservoir 4 (8), Reservoir 5 (7), Reservoir 6 (11), Reservoir 7 (14), and Reservoir 8 (16).
- From Reservoir 4: Water can flow to Reservoir 0 (4), Reservoir 1 (19), Reservoir 2 (7), Reservoir 3 (14), Reservoir 5 (1), Reservoir 6 (20), Reservoir 7 (14), and Reservoir 8 (16).
- From Reservoir 5: Water can be distributed to Reservoir 2 (14), Reservoir 3 (4), Reservoir 4 (17), Reservoir 6 (2), and Reservoir 7 (20), and Reservoir 8 (9).
- From Reservoir 6: Water can flow to Reservoir 0 (12), Reservoir 1 (19), Reservoir 2 (3), Reservoir 3 (3), Reservoir 7 (13), and Reservoir 8 (3).
- From Reservoir 7: Water can be distributed to Reservoir 0 (8), Reservoir 1 (19), Reservoir 2 (16), Reservoir 3 (4), Reservoir 4 (6), Reservoir 5 (13), Reservoir 6 (9), and Reservoir 8 (15).
- From Reservoir 8 (Destination): Water can flow back to Reservoir 0 (11), Reservoir 1 (6), Reservoir 3 (6), Reservoir 4 (10), Reservoir 5 (9), and Reservoir 6 (3), and Reservoir 7 (1).

In this complex network, a pipeline capacity of "0" indicates that there is no direct connection between those two reservoirs.

The city's goal is to ensure that the water supply can meet the growing demands by calculating the maximum amount of water that can be distributed from Reservoir 0 (the primary source) to Reservoir 8 (the main distribution hub) each day, without exceeding the capacities of the pipelines.

What is the optimal value of water (in millions of gallons per day) that can be maximally distributed from the source to the destination?
