Imagine a scenario where a salesperson needs to visit five distinct cities to meet clients and finalize deals. These cities are labeled as City 1, City 2, City 3, City 4, and City 5. The salesperson can initiate their journey from any city, but the challenge is to visit each other city exactly once and then return to the starting city, all while attempting to minimize the total travel cost involved.

Here's a summary of the travel costs between the cities:
- From City 1, the travel costs are: to City 2 is 40 units, to City 3 is 40 units, to City 4 is 56 units, and to City 5 is 93 units.
- From City 2, the travel costs are: to City 1 is 40 units, to City 3 is 52 units, to City 4 is 71 units, and to City 5 is 90 units.
- From City 3, the travel costs are: to City 1 is 40 units, to City 2 is 52 units, to City 4 is 57 units, and to City 5 is 14 units.
- From City 4, the travel costs are: to City 1 is 56 units, to City 2 is 71 units, to City 3 is 57 units, and to City 5 is 13 units.
- From City 5, the travel costs are: to City 1 is 93 units, to City 2 is 90 units, to City 3 is 14 units, and to City 4 is 13 units.

Now, what is the minimum total travel cost for the salesperson to visit each city exactly once and return to their starting city?
