An air traffic controller needs to control the landing times of n aircrafts: Flights must land in the order 1, ..., n. Flight j must land in time interval [aj , bj ]. n = 10. [a1, b1] = [40, 67], [a2, b2] = [11, 87], [a3, b3] = [35,94], [a4, b4] = [38,96], [a5, b5] = [74,105], [a6, b6] = [87,137], [a7, b7] = [62,121], [a8, b8] = [75,143], [a9, b9] = [94,172], [a10, b10] = [128,151]. The objective is to maximize the minimum separation time, which is the interval between two landings. Find the maximal minimum separation. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest time.
