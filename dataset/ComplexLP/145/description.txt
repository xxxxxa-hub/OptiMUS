In the bustling landscape of retail and distribution, LogicFlow Inc. is at a pivotal juncture aiming to streamline its supply chain for maximum efficiency and minimal cost. The company needs to determine the best strategy for distributing products to its eight retail stores, which are scattered across different locations. The challenge lies in selecting from eight potential distribution centers, each with its unique opening cost and varying transportation costs per unit to the stores. The goal is clear: to fulfill the demand of every retail store while keeping the overall costs as low as possible.

The specifics of this optimization scenario are as follows:

- There are 8 potential Distribution Centers that LogicFlow Inc. is considering.
- The company operates 8 Retail Stores requiring supplies.

The Opening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars) are listed below:
- Distribution Center 1: $151,000
- Distribution Center 2: $192,000
- Distribution Center 3: $114,000
- Distribution Center 4: $171,000
- Distribution Center 5: $160,000
- Distribution Center 6: $120,000
- Distribution Center 7: $182,000
- Distribution Center 8: $186,000

Transportation Costs Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Each Retail Store (in dollars) are detailed as follows:
- From Distribution Center 1 to Stores: $3 to Store 1, and so on, up to $4 to Store 8.
- From Distribution Center 2 to Stores: $2 to Store 1, up to $4 to Store 8.
- This pattern continues, reflecting the variability and strategic considerations in choosing the optimal distribution center locations and the dispatch of goods to the retail stores.

The Demand of Each Retail Store (in units) is:
- Store 1: 695 units, continuing in a similar manner up to Store 8: 440 units.

The Supply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units) is as follows:
- Distribution Center 1: 1980 units, with similar details provided for each center, ending with Distribution Center 8: 1962 units.

Given these particulars, LogicFlow Inc. must make a calculated decision on which distribution centers to open and the most cost-efficient way to transport goods to meet the demands of all eight retail stores. The decision matrix includes opening costs for each center, the transportation cost per unit to each store, and the capacity to meet the store demands.

Question:
What is the optimal total cost for LogicFlow Inc. to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods in order to satisfy the demands of all eight retail stores? This total cost must include both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores.
