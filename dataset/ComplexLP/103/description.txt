Welcome to the scenario of an intricate transportation network connecting 8 bustling cities, designed to efficiently distribute essential supplies during a crisis. Each city is a node in this network, ranging from the primary distribution center (the source) to a central hub designated as the destination. The connections between these cities are roads, each with a specific carrying capacity that denotes the maximum amount of supplies (in tons) that can traverse these roads per day.

Here's the layout of the road capacities between cities:

- From City 0 (Source): Supplies can be sent to City 1 (11 tons), City 2 (1 ton), City 3 (6 tons), City 4 (4 tons), City 5 (5 tons), City 6 (7 tons), and City 7 (1 ton).
- From City 1: Supplies can be routed to City 0 (3 tons), City 2 (15 tons), City 3 (15 tons), City 4 (16 tons), City 5 (9 tons), City 6 (14 tons), and City 7 (12 tons).
- From City 2: Can dispatch supplies to City 0 (19 tons), City 1 (9 tons), City 3 (5 tons), City 4 (9 tons), City 5 (11 tons), City 6 (16 tons), and City 7 (3 tons).
- From City 3: Can send supplies to City 0 (15 tons), City 1 (1 ton), City 2 (14 tons), City 4 (0 tons, indicating no direct road), City 5 (4 tons), City 6 (1 ton), and City 7 (15 tons).
- From City 4: Can transport supplies to City 0 (8 tons), City 1 (16 tons), City 2 (7 tons), City 3 (3 tons), City 5 (16 tons), City 6 (10 tons), and City 7 (11 tons).
- From City 5: Supplies can be moved to City 0 (7 tons), City 1 (8 tons), City 2 (1 ton), City 3 (11 tons), City 4 (19 tons), City 6 (3 tons), and City 7 (3 tons).
- From City 6: Can route supplies to City 0 (2 tons), City 1 (19 tons), City 2 (2 tons), City 3 (6 tons), City 4 (12 tons), City 5 (20 tons), and City 7 (6 tons).
- From City 7 (Destination): Supplies can be sent back to City 0 (15 tons), City 1 (17 tons), City 2 (4 tons), City 3 (7 tons), City 4 (8 tons), City 5 (2 tons), and City 6 (16 tons).

In this system, a capacity of "0" signifies no direct roadway connection between the two cities.

The challenge is to determine the maximum amount of supplies that can be delivered from City 0 (the source) to City 7 (the destination) per day, without exceeding the road capacities.

What is the maximum amount of supplies, in tons, that can be transported from the source to the destination in one day?
