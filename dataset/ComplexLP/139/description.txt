SupplyLink, a major supplier, is looking to optimize its distribution network to ensure the efficient supply of goods to its five retail stores from a selection of five potential distribution centers. Each distribution center incurs an initial opening cost and has a limit on how much it can supply. The transportation cost of goods from these centers to the retail stores also varies. The goal is to meet the demand at each retail store at minimal total cost, which includes the opening costs of distribution centers and the transportation cost of the goods.
