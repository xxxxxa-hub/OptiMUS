Before one World Cup championship, there are 5 types of securities available for sale. The price of each share of the security is fixed and the payoff of it will be contingent on the outcome of the outcome of the world cup. The information of the 5 securities are shown in Table 1.

There are five countries, Argentina, Brazil, England, Spain, Germany. Security 1 has a price of 0.75 and a share limit of 10. The payoff for this security is $1 in Argentina, $1 in Brazil, $1 in England, 0 in Germany, and 0 in Spain. Security 2 is priced at 0.35 with a share limit of 5. The payoff is 0 for Argentina, Brazil, or England, but it's $1 for Germany and Spain. Security 3 has a price of 0.40 and a share limit of 10.
