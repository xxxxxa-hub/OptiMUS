There are two special nodes marked as S (likely the start) and T (likely the target or terminal). The other nodes are numbered from 2 to 7. Edges connect these nodes and each edge is labeled with a number indicating its weight. Node S is connected to nodes 2 and 3 with edge weights of 5 and 4, respectively. Node 2 is connected to node S with a weight of 5, to node 4 with a weight of 3, and to node 3 with a weight of 2. Node 3 is connected to node S with a weight of 4, to node 2 with a weight of 2, to node 5 with a weight of 1, and to node 6 with a weight of 7. Node 4 is connected to node 2 with a weight of 3 and to node 6 with a weight of 2. Node 5 is connected to node 3 with a weight of 1 and to node T with a weight of 5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7 with edge weights of 7, 2, and 3, respectively. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and T with edge weights of 3 and 1, respectively. Node T is connected to nodes 5 and 7 with edge weights of 5 and 1, respectively. Considering the weight as distance, find the shortest distance from S to T.Provide your answer rounded to the nearest meter.
