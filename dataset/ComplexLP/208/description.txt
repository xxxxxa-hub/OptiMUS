My diet requires that all the food I eat come from one of the four 'basic food groups' (chocolate cake, ice cream, soda, and cheesecake). At present, the following four foods are available for consumption: brownies, chocolate ice cream, cola, and pineapple cheesecake. The nutritional content per unit of each food is as follows: each brownie provides 400 calories, 3 oz of chocolate, 2 oz of sugar, and 2 oz of fat; each scoop of chocolate ice cream provides 200 calories, 2 oz of chocolate, 2 oz of sugar, and 4 oz of fat; each bottle of cola provides 150 calories, 0 oz of chocolate, 4 oz of sugar, and 1 oz of fat; and each piece of pineapple cheesecake provides 500 calories, 0 oz of chocolate, 4 oz of sugar, and 5 oz of fat. The costs are 50¢ for each brownie, 20¢ for each scoop of chocolate ice cream, 30¢ for each bottle of cola, and 80¢ for each piece of pineapple cheesecake. Each day, I must ingest at least 500 calories, 6 oz of chocolate, 10 oz of sugar, and 8 oz of fat. Formulate a linear programming model that can be used to satisfy my daily nutritional requirements at minimum cost. Find the minimal cost.
