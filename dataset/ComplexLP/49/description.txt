Imagine you are coordinating a logistics effort to redistribute essential supplies among seven regional distribution centers. Each center starts with a specific quantity of supplies but has different needs to ensure smooth operations across the regions.

Here's the initial setup:

- Distribution Center 1 has 97 units but needs 119 units.
- Distribution Center 2 has 458 units but needs 275 units.
- Distribution Center 3 has 473 units but needs only 36 units.
- Distribution Center 4 has 380 units but needs 459 units.
- Distribution Center 5 has 34 units but needs 17 units.
- Distribution Center 6 has 399 units but needs 128 units.
- Distribution Center 7 has 163 units but needs 425 units.

To move supplies between these centers, there is a cost associated with each transfer, which varies depending on the route. Here's the cost matrix showing the cost to transfer supplies from one center to another:

- From/To Center 1: To 2 costs 41, to 3 costs 42, to 4 costs 31, to 5 costs 39, to 6 costs 2, to 7 costs 18.
- From/To Center 2: To 1 costs 48, to 3 costs 9, to 4 costs 22, to 5 costs 47, to 6 costs 29, to 7 costs 39.
- From/To Center 3: To 1 costs 36, to 2 costs 22, to 4 costs 29, to 5 costs 45, to 6 costs 33, to 7 costs 45.
- From/To Center 4: To 1 costs 19, to 2 costs 5, to 3 costs 10, to 5 costs 3, to 6 costs 42, to 7 costs 20.
- From/To Center 5: To 1 costs 13, to 2 costs 10, to 3 costs 21, to 4 costs 7, to 6 costs 35, to 7 costs 11.
- From/To Center 6: To 1 costs 5, to 2 costs 35, to 3 costs 29, to 4 costs 16, to 5 costs 40, to 7 costs 9.
- From/To Center 7: To 1 costs 7, to 2 costs 24, to 3 costs 26, to 4 costs 38, to 5 costs 33, to 6 costs 13.

Your task is to ensure each distribution center has the supplies it needs while minimizing the total cost of redistribution. What would be the minimum cost to achieve this?
