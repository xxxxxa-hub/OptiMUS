Star Oil Company is considering five different investment opportunities. The cash outflows and net present values (NPVs) (in millions of dollars) for each opportunity are given in Table 7. Specifically, Investment 1 has a time 0 cash outflow of $11 million and a time 1 cash outflow of $3 million, with an NPV of $13 million. Investment 2 requires a time 0 outflow of $53 million and a time 1 outflow of $6 million, yielding an NPV of $16 million. Investment 3 has smaller outflows of $5 million at both time 0 and time 1 and also an NPV of $16 million. Investment 4 asks for a time 0 outflow of $5 million and a minimal $1 million at time 1, with an NPV of $14 million. Lastly, Investment 5 requires a $29 million outflow at time 0 and a significant $34 million at time 1, resulting in the highest NPV of $39 million. Star Oil has $40 million available for investment at time 0, and it estimates that $20 million will be available for investment at time 1. Star Oil may purchase any fraction of each investment, in which case, the cash outflows and NPV are adjusted proportionally. For example, if Star Oil purchases one-fifth of investment 3, then a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 0, and a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 1. The one-fifth share of investment 3 would yield an NPV of (1/5)*16=3.2 million dollars or $3.2 million. Star Oil wants to maximize the NPV that can be obtained by investing in investments 1-5. The goal is to formulate an LP that will help achieve this objective. Assume that any funds left over at time 0 cannot be used at time 1. Find the maximum NPV in million dollars.
