A graph with 10 vertices and a series of edges connecting them. Each vertex is labeled with a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'j'. The vertices labeled 'a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', and 'j' are colored in red, while 'b', 'e', 'h', and 'i' are colored in blue. The red vertices seem to form a set that covers all the edges of the graph, indicating a solution to the vertex cover problem. The vertex cover problem is a classical optimization problem where the goal is to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The graph itself has a pentagonal structure on the outer edges, with an additional five vertices inside the pentagon that are fully interconnected, forming a complete graph K5 (every vertex inside the pentagon is connected to every other vertex inside). The graph is not planar as there are edges that cross each other. In terms of vertex connections: Vertex 'a' connects to vertices 'f', 'e', and 'b'. Vertex 'b' connect to vertices 'a', 'g', and 'c'. Vertex 'c' connects to vertices 'b', 'h', and 'd'. Vertex 'd' connects to vertices 'c', 'i', and 'e'. Vertex 'e' connects to vertices 'd', 'j', and 'a'. The vertices inside the pentagon ('f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j') are all interconnected. The red-colored vertices ('a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'j') suggest a possible vertex cover, indicating they are a proposed solution to ensure that all edges of the graph are covered. Find the minimum vertex cover. Provide your answer rounded to nearest integar.
