Imagine a country with six major cities, each city being a node in a complex railway network, spanning from City 0 (the source) to City 5 (the destination). These cities are connected by multiple railway tracks, each capable of handling a specific number of trains per day.

Here's a detailed description of the railway tracks and their capacities, which indicates the maximum number of trains that can travel between two cities in a day:

- From City 0: Up to 17 trains can travel to City 1, 14 trains to City 2, 13 trains to City 3, 11 trains to City 4, and 3 trains to City 5.
- From City 1: 1 train can travel back to City 0, 18 trains to City 2, 14 trains to City 3, 12 trains to City 4, and 16 trains to City 5.
- From City 2: 5 trains can travel back to City 0, 1 train to City 1, 7 trains to City 3, 2 trains to City 4, and 5 trains to City 5.
- From City 3: 10 trains can travel back to City 0, 13 trains to City 1, 19 trains to City 2, 4 trains to City 4, and 16 trains to City 5.
- From City 4: 3 trains can travel back to City 0, no trains to City 1, 13 trains to City 2, no trains to City 3, and 14 trains to City 5.
- From City 5 (Destination): 15 trains can travel back to City 0, 16 trains to City 1, 4 trains to City 2, 1 train to City 3, and 16 trains to City 4.

In this scenario, a capacity of "0" indicates that there is no direct railway track between those two cities.

Given this information, your task is to determine the maximum number of trains that can be dispatched from City 0 (the source) to City 5 (the destination) in a single day, without exceeding the capacity of any individual track. What is the maximum number of trains that can travel from the source to the destination in a day?
