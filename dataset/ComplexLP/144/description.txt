In the bustling world of retail, LogiChain, a renowned logistics company, is at a crossroads in determining the most efficient way to distribute products to its network of eight retail stores. The challenge lies in selecting from four strategic distribution centers, each with its distinct opening costs and supply capacities. The goal is to ensure that each store's demand is met with the least total cost, incorporating both the opening of distribution centers and the transportation costs of delivering goods.

Here are the specifics of the situation:

- There are eight retail stores in need of supplies, each with its unique demand.
- The transportation cost per unit of product varies not only from one distribution center to another but also from one store to another.

The details are as follows:

Opening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):
- Center 1: $151,000
- Center 2: $192,000
- Center 3: $114,000
- Center 4: $171,000

Transportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):
- From Center 1: $5 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7, $4 to Store 8
