Imagine we're planning the logistics for a new high-speed data network connecting 8 major data centers across the country. This network is designed to optimize the flow of information, functioning much like a water distribution system, but for data. Each data center is connected to others through high-capacity data transmission lines, each with a specific capacity for data flow measured in terabits per second (Tbps).

Here's the setup of this futuristic data network, detailing the maximum data flow capacity from one center to another:

- From Data Center 0 (Source): Can send data to Data Center 1 (5 Tbps), Data Center 2 (16 Tbps), Data Center 3 (11 Tbps), Data Center 4 (2 Tbps), Data Center 5 (10 Tbps), Data Center 6 (17 Tbps), and Data Center 7 (2 Tbps).
- From Data Center 1: Can send data to Data Center 0 (8 Tbps), Data Center 2 (14 Tbps), Data Center 3 (14 Tbps), Data Center 4 (2 Tbps), Data Center 5 (7 Tbps), Data Center 6 (11 Tbps), and Data Center 7 (1 Tbps).
- From Data Center 2: Can send data to Data Center 0 (17 Tbps), Data Center 1 (20 Tbps), Data Center 3 (16 Tbps), Data Center 4 (13 Tbps), Data Center 6 (6 Tbps), and Data Center 7 (1 Tbps).
- From Data Center 3: Can send data to Data Center 0 (3 Tbps), Data Center 1 (16 Tbps), Data Center 2 (10 Tbps), Data Center 4 (19 Tbps), Data Center 5 (12 Tbps), Data Center 6 (3 Tbps), and Data Center 7 (15 Tbps).
- From Data Center 4: Can send data to Data Center 0 (15 Tbps), Data Center 1 (12 Tbps), Data Center 2 (19 Tbps), Data Center 3 (18 Tbps), Data Center 5 (14 Tbps), Data Center 6 (12 Tbps), and Data Center 7 (15 Tbps).
- From Data Center 5: Can send data to Data Center 0 (2 Tbps), Data Center 1 (20 Tbps), Data Center 2 (20 Tbps), Data Center 3 (17 Tbps), Data Center 4 (4 Tbps), Data Center 6 (10 Tbps), and Data Center 7 (17 Tbps).
- From Data Center 6: Can send data to Data Center 0 (15 Tbps), Data Center 1 (13 Tbps), Data Center 2 (13 Tbps), Data Center 3 (5 Tbps), Data Center 4 (10 Tbps), Data Center 5 (15 Tbps), and Data Center 7 (19 Tbps).
- From Data Center 7 (Destination): Can send data back to Data Center 0 (10 Tbps), Data Center 1 (3 Tbps), Data Center 2 (14 Tbps), Data Center 3 (11 Tbps), Data Center 4 (5 Tbps), Data Center 5 (20 Tbps), and Data Center 6 (4 Tbps).

In this network, a capacity of "0" indicates that there is no direct data line connecting those two centers.

The objective is to determine the maximum amount of data (in Tbps) that can be transmitted from Data Center 0 (the source) to Data Center 7 (the destination), ensuring that the flow through each data line does not exceed its specified capacity. What is the maximum amount of data that can be sent from the source to the destination in terabits per second?
