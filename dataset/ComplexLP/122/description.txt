Welcome to a complex and engaging scenario involving a futuristic transportation network connecting 8 critical hubs across a sprawling metropolis. This network, designed with cutting-edge technology, facilitates the seamless flow of resources - be it energy, data, or materials - from the primary distribution center to the ultimate receiving facility, ensuring the city's heartbeat never skips a beat.

Here's a detailed layout of the transportation capacities between these hubs, measured in units of resources per hour that can be transmitted:

- From Hub 0 (Source): Can dispatch resources to Hub 1 (15 units), Hub 2 (19 units), Hub 3 (4 units), Hub 4 (4 units), Hub 5 (3 units), Hub 6 (20 units), and Hub 7 (17 units).
- From Hub 1: Can transmit to Hub 0 (8 units), Hub 2 (6 units), Hub 3 (5 units), Hub 4 (20 units), Hub 5 (3 units), Hub 6 (15 units), and Hub 7 (1 unit).
- From Hub 2: Can route resources to Hub 0 (11 units), Hub 1 (13 units), Hub 3 (16 units), Hub 4 (15 units), Hub 5 (7 units), Hub 6 (10 units), and Hub 7 (13 units).
- From Hub 3: Can send to Hub 0 (17 units), Hub 1 (20 units), Hub 2 (6 units), Hub 4 (11 units), Hub 5 (3 units), Hub 6 (2 units).
- From Hub 4: Can distribute to Hub 0 (10 units), Hub 1 (15 units), Hub 2 (5 units), Hub 5 (9 units), Hub 6 (9 units), and Hub 7 (15 units).
- From Hub 5: Can forward to Hub 0 (9 units), Hub 1 (17 units), Hub 2 (5 units), Hub 3 (1 unit), Hub 4 (9 units), Hub 6 (20 units), and Hub 7 (2 units).
- From Hub 6: Can transfer to Hub 0 (4 units), Hub 1 (16 units), Hub 2 (10 units), Hub 3 (2 units), Hub 4 (1 unit), Hub 5 (6 units), and Hub 7 (4 units).
- Lastly, Hub 7 (Destination): Can receive back from Hubs 0 through 6 various capacities, with the specifics already detailed above, marking the end of our resource flow chain.

In this futuristic city, a "0" capacity means there is no established direct transmission link between those particular hubs.

The critical task at hand is to determine the maximum amount of resources that can be transported from Hub 0 (the source) to Hub 7 (the destination) per hour without overloading any part of this intricate network. What is the maximum resource flow, in units per hour, that can be achieved from the source to the destination?
