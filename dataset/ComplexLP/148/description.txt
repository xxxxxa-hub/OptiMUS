In an intricate dance of supply chain optimization, GlobalSupply Inc. is at a crossroads, tasked with the pivotal decision of efficiently distributing its products to seven distinct retail stores. This challenge is compounded by the need to select the most cost-effective combination of distribution centers from a pool of nine potential sites. Each potential distribution center is not only geographically unique but also comes with its own set of opening costs and maximum supply capacities. Additionally, the transportation cost per unit of product varies significantly from one distribution center to another, adding layers of complexity to the decision-making process.
