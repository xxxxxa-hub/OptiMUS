Semicond is a small electronics company that manufactures tape recorders and radios. The per-unit labor costs for tape recorders and radios are $50 and $35 respectively, and the raw material costs are $30 for tape recorders and $40 for radios. The selling prices are $100 for a tape recorder and $90 for a radio, as outlined in Table 10. On December 1, 2002, Semicond has enough raw material to manufacture 100 tape recorders and 100 radios. On the same date, the company’s balance sheet shows cash at $10,000, accounts receivable at $3,000, and inventory outstanding valued at $7,000, with a bank loan liability of $10,000, resulting in a current ratio of 2 ($20,000 in total assets over $10,000 in liabilities), as shown in Table 11. Semicond must decide how many tape recorders and radios to produce during December, considering that demand is high enough to sell all units produced. Although all sales in December will be on credit, with payment not received until February 1, 2003, Semicond will collect $2,000 in accounts receivable in December. Furthermore, Semicond has to pay off $1,000 of its loan and a monthly rent of $1,000 in December. On January 1, 2003, Semicond will receive raw materials worth $2,000, to be paid for on February 1, 2003. Management has mandated a minimum cash balance of $4,000 for January 1, 2003. Additionally, to satisfy bank requirements, the current ratio on January 1 must be at least 2. Find the maximal contribution to profit from December’s production in $.
