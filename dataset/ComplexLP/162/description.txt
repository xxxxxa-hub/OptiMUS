SupplyTek is a retail supply company that needs to optimize its distribution network. The company has four retail stores that require supply from a choice of seven possible distribution centers. Each center comes with its own opening cost and a limit on how much it can supply. The cost of transporting goods from these centers to the retail stores varies. The objective is to meet the demand at each retail store at the minimum possible total cost, which includes the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of the goods.
