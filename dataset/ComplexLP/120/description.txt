Imagine a futuristic transportation network connecting 9 major hubs across a sprawling metropolis, each designed to swiftly move resources from the main distribution center to a critical operations base. This network is meticulously engineered with roads of varying capacities, ensuring the smooth flow of essential supplies.

The city's network is as follows, with each road's capacity measured in thousands of units of resources that can be transported per hour:

- From Hub 0 (Source): Roads lead to Hub 1 (4 units), Hub 2 (7 units), Hub 3 (15 units), Hub 4 (4 units), Hub 5 (7 units), Hub 6 (2 units), Hub 7 (10 units), and Hub 8 (12 units).
- From Hub 1: Roads lead to Hub 2 (17 units), Hub 3 (2 units), Hub 4 (5 units), Hub 5 (1 unit), Hub 6 (10 units), Hub 7 (14 units), and Hub 8 (5 units).
- From Hub 2: Roads lead to Hub 1 (7 units), Hub 3 (17 units), Hub 4 (9 units), Hub 5 (13 units), Hub 6 (10 units), Hub 7 (7 units), and Hub 8 (5 units).
- From Hub 3: Roads lead to Hub 1 (16 units), Hub 2 (4 units), Hub 4 (11 units), Hub 5 (9 units), Hub 6 (12 units), Hub 7 (18 units), and Hub 8 (12 units).
- From Hub 4: Roads lead to Hub 1 (3 units), Hub 2 (0 units), Hub 3 (18 units), Hub 5 (5 units), Hub 6 (2 units), and Hub 8 (19 units).
- From Hub 5: Roads lead to Hub 1 (15 units), Hub 2 (7 units), Hub 3 (20 units), Hub 4 (20 units), Hub 6 (20 units), Hub 7 (12 units), and Hub 8 (9 units).
- From Hub 6: Roads lead to Hub 1 (8 units), Hub 2 (14 units), Hub 3 (13 units), Hub 4 (1 unit), Hub 5 (17 units), Hub 7 (10 units), and Hub 8 (19 units).
- From Hub 7: Roads lead to Hub 1 (5 units), Hub 2 (5 units), Hub 3 (16 units), Hub 4 (5 units), Hub 5 (7 units), Hub 6 (3 units), and Hub 8 (19 units).
- From Hub 8 (Destination): Roads lead back to Hub 1 (19 units), Hub 2 (18 units), Hub 3 (0 units), Hub 4 (4 units), Hub 5 (7 units), Hub 6 (1 unit), and Hub 7 (20 units).

A capacity of "0" indicates that there is no direct road connecting those two hubs.

This complex system has been designed with an aim to maximize the resources transported from Hub 0, the primary distribution center, to Hub 8, the critical operations base, without exceeding the capacity of the roads connecting these hubs.

The challenge: What is the maximum amount of resources, in thousands of units, that can be transported from the primary distribution center (Hub 0) to the critical operations base (Hub 8) per hour?
