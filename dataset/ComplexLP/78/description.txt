Consider a delivery driver who must deliver parcels to six different locations named A through F. The driver can begin the delivery route from any location, but they must visit each location exactly once before returning to the starting point. The objective for the driver is to find the route that minimizes the total delivery cost, which could be based on distance, time, or fuel consumption.

Here are the specific delivery costs between the locations:
It costs 77 units to deliver from Location A to B, 89 units to C, 19 units to D, 31 units to E, and 62 units to F.
From Location B, the delivery cost to A is 77 units, to C is 36 units, to D is 81 units, to E is 71 units, and to F is 93 units.
For Location C, it costs 89 units to deliver to A, 36 units to B, 32 units to D, 48 units to E, and 36 units to F.
From Location D, the delivery costs are 19 units to A, 81 units to B, 32 units to C, 98 units to E, and 82 units to F.
For deliveries from Location E, the costs are 31 units to A, 71 units to B, 48 units to C, 98 units to D, and 66 units to F.
Finally, from Location F, it costs 62 units to deliver to A, 93 units to B, 36 units to C, 82 units to D, and 66 units to E.

Given this information, what is the minimum total delivery cost for the driver to deliver parcels to each location exactly once and return to the starting location?
