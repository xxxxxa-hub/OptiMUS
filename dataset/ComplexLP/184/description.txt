The China Railroad Ministry is in the process of planning relocations of freight cars among 5 regions of the country to get ready for the fall harvest. location 1 to 3 costs 11 units. Moving a car from location 1 to 4 costs 13 units. Moving a car from location 1 to 5 costs 28 units. Moving a car from location 2 to 3 costs 18 units. Moving a car from location 2 to 4 costs 8 units. Moving a car from location 2 to 5 costs 46 units. Moving a car from location 3 to 4 costs 9 units. Moving a car from location 3 to 5 costs 27 units. Moving a car from location 4 to 5 costs 20 units. At location 1, there are currently 120 cars present, but 150 cars are needed. At location 2, there are currently 330 cars present, but 200 cars are needed. At location 3, there are currently 400 cars present, but 600 cars are needed. At location 4, there are currently 400 cars present, but 200 cars are needed. At location 5, there are currently 600 cars present, but 400 cars are needed. Write down a linear optimization to compute the least costly way to move the cars such us the need is met.Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
