The China Railroad Ministry is in the process of planning relocations of freight cars among 5 regions of the country to get ready for the fall harvest. The following presents the costs of moving a car between each pair of regions. The costs are as follows: moving a car from region 1 to region 2 costs 10 units, to region 3 costs 12 units, to region 4 costs 17 units, and to region 5 costs 34 units. From region 2 to region 1 costs 10 units, to region 3 costs 18 units, to region 4 costs 8 units, and to region 5 costs 46 units. From region 3, moving a car to region 1 costs 12 units, to region 2 costs 18 units, to region 4 costs 9 units, and to region 5 costs 27 units. From region 4, the cost to move a car to region 1 is 17 units, to region 2 is 8 units, to region 3 is 9 units, and to region 5 is 20 units. Lastly, from region 5 to region 1 the cost is 34 units, to region 2 is 46 units, to region 3 is 27 units, and to region 4 is 20 units. The following displays the current number of cars and the number needed for harvest shipping in each region. Region 1 currently has 115 cars but needs 300. Region 2 has 385 cars available but requires 400. Region 3 has 410 cars against a need of 800. Region 4 is currently equipped with 480 cars, yet the need is only for 200. Finally, region 5 has 610 cars available, with a need for 300 cars. Minimize the cost to move the cars such as the need is met. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
