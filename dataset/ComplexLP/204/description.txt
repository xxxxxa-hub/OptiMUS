Chip Green is the head groundskeeper at Birdie Valley Golf Club. For the mix of grass for the golf course, Chip has decided that the best fertilizer would be a 10-8-12 mixture. Fertilizer is defined by three values—a, b, and c—where a is the percentage of nitrogen (Ni), b is the percentage of phosphorus (Ph), and c is the percentage of potash (Po) in the fertilizer. The remaining material is inert matter. Chip can buy a 10-8-12 mix of fertilizer for $21.75 per 100 pounds, but there are other fertilizers on the market at a variety of prices. The chemical content and prices per 100 pounds for these fertilizers are as follows: fertilizer 1 has a 10-8-12 mix at $21.75, fertilizer 2 has an 8-11-15 mix at $23.50, fertilizer 3 has a 12-7-12 mix at $22.00, fertilizer 4 has a 10-10-10 mix at $19.50, and fertilizer 5 has a 15-10-6 mix at $18.50. Chip would like to determine whether or not he could buy several fertilizers and mix them together to obtain a 10-8-12 mixture at a lower cost than $21.75 per 100 pounds. Recognizing that it might be impossible to obtain an exact 10-8-12 mix from the fertilizers, Chip is willing to accept chemical percentages of at least the target amounts, but no more than 0.5% above them (so the nitrogen level should be between 10% and 10.5%, phosphorus between 8% and 8.5%, and potash between 12% and 12.5%). Find the minimal cost per pound of fertilizer that meets these conditions.
