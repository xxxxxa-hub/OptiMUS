Consider a complex transportation network connecting 9 cities, where goods are moved from a central warehouse (City 0) to a major marketplace (City 8). Trucks of different capacities are assigned to each route between the cities. 

Here's the maximum capacity of goods (in tons) each truck can move from one city to another:

- From City 0 (Warehouse): Trucks can move goods to City 1 (15 tons), City 2 (12 tons), City 3 (9 tons), City 4 (7 tons), City 5 (12 tons), City 6 (5 tons), City 7 (20 tons), and City 8 (10 tons).
- From City 1: Trucks can move goods to City 0 (6 tons), City 2 (8 tons), City 4 (19 tons), City 5 (14 tons), City 6 (17 tons), City 7 (9 tons), and City 8 (16 tons).
- From City 2: Trucks can move goods to City 0 (19 tons), City 1 (11 tons), City 4 (13 tons), City 5 (14 tons), City 6 (17 tons), City 7 (10 tons), and City 8 (13 tons).
- From City 3: Trucks can move goods to City 0 (15 tons), City 1 (4 tons), City 2 (5 tons), City 4 (2 tons), City 5 (18 tons), City 6 (6 tons), City 7 (17 tons), and City 8 (19 tons).
- From City 4: Trucks can move goods to City 0 (2 tons), City 1 (8 tons), City 2 (2 tons), City 3 (4 tons), City 5 (6 tons), City 6 (14 tons), City 7 (20 tons), and City 8 (18 tons).
- From City 5: Trucks can move goods to City 0 (14 tons), City 1 (9 tons), City 2 (18 tons), City 3 (7 tons), City 4 (4 tons), City 6 (11 tons), City 7 (11 tons), and City 8 (13 tons).
- From City 6: Trucks can move goods to City 0 (12 tons), City 1 (14 tons), City 2 (12 tons), City 3 (4 tons), City 4 (18 tons), City 5 (6 tons), City 7 (5 tons), and City 8 (4 tons).
- From City 7: Trucks can move goods to City 0 (20 tons), City 1 (1 ton), City 2 (6 tons), City 3 (17 tons), City 4 (4 tons), City 5 (2 tons), City 6 (11 tons), and City 8 (9 tons).
- From City 8 (Marketplace): Trucks can move goods back to City 0 (16 tons), City 1 (6 tons), City 2 (14 tons), City 3 (0 tons), City 4 (17 tons), City 5 (17 tons), City 6 (6 tons), and City 7 (9 tons).

In this setup, a capacity of "0" means there is no truck allocated to move goods between those two cities.

The challenge is to calculate the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from City 0 (the Warehouse) to City 8 (the Marketplace) without exceeding the capacity of any truck on its route. What is the maximum quantity of goods that can be transported from the warehouse to the marketplace in tons?
