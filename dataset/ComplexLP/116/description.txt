Visualize a sophisticated network of digital information pathways connecting 9 pivotal data centers across a vast metropolitan area. These centers, numbered from 0 to 8, form the backbone of the city's communication infrastructure, with the primary data hub at Center 0 acting as the source of all transmissions. The objective is to ensure the maximum flow of information reaches Center 8, the main processing facility, thus optimizing the network's overall efficiency.

The capacities of the digital pathways, measured in terabytes per hour, dictate how much information can flow between each pair of data centers:

- From Data Center 0 (Source): Can transmit information to Center 1 (11 TB), Center 2 (11 TB), Center 3 (14 TB), Center 4 (6 TB), Center 5 (11 TB), Center 6 (4 TB), Center 7 (15 TB), and Center 8 (9 TB).
- From Data Center 1: Can transmit information to Centers ranging from 2 to 8, with capacities varying between 1 TB to 20 TB, with no direct connection back to Center 0.
- From Data Center 2: Features a range of capacities to other centers, including a high capacity of 18 TB to Centers 1 and 5, among others.
- Similar patterns of connectivity and capacities exist for Centers 3 through 7, detailing a complex web of information flow through the network with capacities ranging from as low as 1 TB to as high as 20 TB.
- Lastly, Data Center 8 can receive information but has pathways leading back into the network, indicating a sophisticated feedback loop essential for network integrity and data processing.

This intricate network is devoid of direct connections in certain instances, symbolizing the absence of direct communication lines between specific data centers.

The paramount task at hand is to calculate the maximum possible transmission of information, from the source at Data Center 0 to the main processing facility at Data Center 8, per hour. This calculation must ensure that the flow through each digital pathway does not exceed its maximum capacity.

What is the maximum amount of information, in terabytes per hour, that can be transmitted from the source to the main processing facility within this network?
