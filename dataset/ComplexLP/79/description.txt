Imagine a salesperson embarking on a journey to visit five distinct cities—let's name them A, B, C, D, and E—to promote their products. The salesperson has the flexibility to commence their expedition from any of these cities. However, there's a pivotal condition: they must travel to each city exactly once and then return to their initial departure point. The primary objective is to minimize the overall travel cost incurred during this excursion, which encompasses factors such as distance, time, or expenses.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the travel costs between the cities:
- Traveling from City A incurs a cost of 44 units to reach B, 19 units to reach C, 92 units to reach D, and 71 units to reach E.
- City B entails a cost of 44 units to travel to A, 22 units to C, 84 units to D, and 63 units to E.
- For City C, the costs are 19 units to A, 22 units to B, 47 units to D, and 89 units to E.
- Moving on to City D, it involves a cost of 92 units to reach A, 84 units to B, 47 units to C, and 78 units to E.
- Finally, from City E, the costs are 71 units to A, 63 units to B, 89 units to C, and 78 units to D.

Given these details, the pivotal question arises: What is the minimum total travel cost for the salesperson to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city?
