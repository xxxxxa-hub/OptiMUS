In this scenario, a salesperson is tasked with visiting six distinct cities to conduct business meetings. The cities are sequentially numbered from 1 to 6. The objective for the salesperson is to devise a route that allows them to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at the same city, while ensuring the total travel cost is minimized. This task is a classic example of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the goal is to find the least expensive route through a network of cities.

The cost of traveling between the cities is as follows:
- From City 1, the travel costs are 49 units to City 2, 34 units to City 3, 18 units to City 4, 62 units to City 5, and 14 units to City 6.
- From City 2, the costs are 49 units back to City 1, 35 units to City 3, 24 units to City 4, 57 units to City 5, and 17 units to City 6.
- From City 3, travel involves 34 units to City 1, 35 units to City 2, 20 units to City 4, 34 units to City 5, and 58 units to City 6.
- From City 4, the costs are 18 units to City 1, 24 units to City 2, 20 units to City 3, 47 units to City 5, and 45 units to City 6.
- From City 5, it costs 62 units to reach City 1, 57 units to City 2, 34 units to City 3, 47 units to City 4, and 71 units to City 6.
- From City 6, the costs are 14 units to City 1, 17 units to City 2, 58 units to City 3, 45 units to City 4, and 71 units to City 5.

What is the minimum total travel cost for the salesperson to visit each of the six cities exactly once and return to the starting city?
