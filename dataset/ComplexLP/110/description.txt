Imagine an intricate and bustling transportation network connecting six major cities in a region. Goods are transported from City 0 (the source) to City 5 (the destination) through numerous highways, each with varying capacities to handle the flow of goods. 

Here is a rundown of the maximum amount of goods (in thousands of tons) that can be transferred between cities per day:

- From City 0 (Source): Can send goods to City 1 (6 tons), City 2 (8 tons), City 3 (1 ton), City 4 (9 tons), and City 5 (8 tons).
- From City 1: Can send goods to City 0 (16 tons), City 2 (6 tons), City 4 (12 tons), and City 5 (16 tons). It has no connection to City 3.
- From City 2: Can send goods to City 0 (7 tons), City 1 (16 tons), City 3 (20 tons), City 4 (17 tons), and City 5 (9 tons).
- From City 3: Can send goods to City 0 (3 tons), City 1 (11 tons), City 2 (14 tons), and City 4 (7 tons). It has no connection to City 5.
- From City 4: Can send goods to City 0 (6 tons), City 1 (19 tons), City 2 (19 tons), City 3 (3 tons), and City 5 (20 tons).
- From City 5 (Destination): Can send goods back to City 0 (20 tons), City 1 (5 tons), City 2 (16 tons), City 3 (12 tons), and City 4 (2 tons).

In this scenario, a capacity of "0" means there is no direct highway connection between those two cities.

The question at hand is to calculate the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from City 0 (the source) to City 5 (the destination) per day while ensuring that the flow of goods on each highway doesn't exceed its capacity. 

So what's the maximum amount of goods that can be transported from the source to the destination per day in thousands of tons?
