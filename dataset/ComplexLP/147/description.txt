LogiChain Solutions is in the process of refining its logistics network to efficiently supply goods to nine retail stores, which are scattered across different locations. The company is considering the feasibility of opening up to eight different distribution centers. Each distribution center has a unique set of operational costs and capacities, as well as varying transportation costs for shipping goods to the retail stores. The challenge lies in selecting the most cost-effective combination of distribution centers to open and determining the optimal shipping routes to fulfill the demands of all retail stores while keeping the total operational and transportation costs as low as possible.
