Consider the following table of food and corresponding nutritional values: Bread contains 4 grams of protein, 7 grams of carbohydrates, has a calorie count of 130, and costs 3 dollar. Milk contains 6 grams of protein, 10 grams of carbohydrates, has a calorie count of 120, and costs 4 dollars. Fish is high in protein with 20 grams, contains no carbohydrates, has a calorie count of 150, and is the most expensive at 8 dollars. Potato contains 1 gram of protein, is high in carbohydrates with 30 grams, has the lowest calorie count at 70, and is the cheapest at 2 dollars. The ideal intake for an adult is at least 40 grams of protein, 50 grams of carbohydrates, and 450 calories per day. The problem is to find the least costly way to achieve those amounts of nutrition by using the four types of food shown in the table. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
