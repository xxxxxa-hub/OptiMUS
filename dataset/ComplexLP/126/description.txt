Welcome to the heart of an intricate transportation network, designed to efficiently distribute a critical resource across 8 bustling hubs of a futuristic city. Each hub, from a massive distribution center to the ultimate delivery point, is interconnected through a series of high-capacity conduits, each with a unique capability to handle the flow of resources.

Here's the detailed layout of this advanced network:

- From Hub 0 (Source): Can dispatch resources to Hub 1 (19 units), Hub 2 (5 units), Hub 3 (7 units), Hub 5 (17 units), and Hub 6 (19 units), with a special direct line to Hub 7 (9 units).
- From Hub 1: Channels resources to Hub 0 (6 units), Hub 2 (15 units), Hub 3 (15 units), Hub 4 (16 units), Hub 5 (8 units), and Hub 6 (5 units).
- From Hub 2: Feeds into Hub 0 (5 units), Hub 1 (6 units), Hub 3 (3 units), Hub 4 (10 units), Hub 5 (7 units), Hub 6 (6 units), and directly to Hub 7 (3 units).
- From Hub 3: Transfers resources back to Hub 0 (8 units), to Hub 1 (2 units), Hub 2 (6 units), Hub 4 (5 units), Hub 5 (17 units), and has a pathway to Hub 7 (1 unit).
- From Hub 4: Sends its resources to Hub 0 (17 units), Hub 1 (4 units), Hub 2 (10 units), Hub 3 (10 units), Hub 5 (6 units), Hub 6 (15 units), and to Hub 7 (14 units) directly.
- From Hub 5: Moves resources to Hub 0 (11 units), Hub 1 (11 units), Hub 2 (9 units), Hub 3 (7 units), Hub 4 (7 units), Hub 6 (16 units), and directly to Hub 7 (19 units).
- From Hub 6: Directs resources back to Hub 0 (13 units), to Hub 1 (19 units), Hub 2 (14 units), Hub 3 (14 units), Hub 4 (16 units), Hub 5 (1 unit), and to Hub 7 (16 units).
- From Hub 7 (Destination): Receives backflow to Hub 0 (0 units), from Hub 1 (14 units), Hub 3 (17 units), Hub 4 (1 unit), Hub 5 (7 units), and Hub 6 (9 units).

In this scenario, a capacity of "0" indicates an absence of a direct conduit between two specific hubs.

The challenge ahead is to determine the maximum amount of resources that can be efficiently transported from Hub 0 (the source) to Hub 7 (the destination) within this network, ensuring the flow through each conduit does not exceed its stated capacity.

What is the maximum unit of resources that can be delivered from the source to the destination?
