Imagine you're coordinating a crucial resource distribution across six different regions to meet specific needs. Each region has a certain stock of resources, but the demands vary, requiring a strategic reallocation to ensure every region's needs are adequately met.

Here's the current and required resource allocation for each region:

- Region 1 has 319 units but needs 243 units.
- Region 2 has 281 units but needs 243 units.
- Region 3 has 247 units but needs 124 units.
- Region 4 has 237 units but needs 202 units.
- Region 5 has 29 units but needs 84 units.
- Region 6 has 453 units but needs 28 units.

Transporting resources between these regions incurs varying costs. The cost matrix detailing the expense of moving resources from one region to another is as follows:

- From Region 1 to other regions: To Region 2 costs 11, to Region 3 costs 30, to Region 4 costs 12, to Region 5 costs 48, to Region 6 costs 23.
- From Region 2 to other regions: To Region 1 costs 1, to Region 3 costs 27, to Region 4 costs 9, to Region 5 costs 26, to Region 6 costs 13.
- From Region 3 to other regions: To Region 1 costs 29, to Region 2 costs 6, to Region 4 costs 27, to Region 5 costs 13, to Region 6 costs 44.
- From Region 4 to other regions: To Region 1 costs 6, to Region 2 costs 50, to Region 3 costs 12, to Region 5 costs 19, to Region 6 costs 32.
- From Region 5 to other regions: To Region 1 costs 26, to Region 2 costs 13, to Region 3 costs 29, to Region 4 costs 2, to Region 6 costs 24.
- From Region 6 to other regions: To Region 1 costs 9, to Region 2 costs 26, to Region 3 costs 2, to Region 4 costs 37, to Region 5 costs 22.

Your task is to calculate the minimum cost required to redistribute the resources so that all regions have exactly what they need. What is the optimal value for the minimum cost of achieving this balance?
