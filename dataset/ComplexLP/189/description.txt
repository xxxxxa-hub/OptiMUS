There are four nodes connected by directed edges. Node 1, which could represent the starting point, is connected to two other nodes: There is an edge from node 1 to node 2 with a capacity of 8. There is an edge from node 1 to node 3 with a capacity of 7. Node 2 is situated at the top of the graph and acts as an intermediate node, with three edges connected to it: An edge leading from node 2 to node 3 with a capacity of 2. An edge leading from node 2 to node 4 with a capacity of 4. Node 3 is another intermediate node and has two edges: An edge from node 3 to node 4 with a substantial capacity of 12. Node 4, which could represent the target or terminal, does not have any edges leading to other nodes, implying that it could be the end point. Find the corresponding maximum flow of the graph. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest integar.
