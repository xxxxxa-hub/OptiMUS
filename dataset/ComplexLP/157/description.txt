SupplyChain Solutions Inc. is facing a complex logistical challenge in optimizing its distribution network. With five retail stores requiring steady supplies and six possible distribution centers to choose from, the task at hand is to find the most cost-effective way to keep the stores well-stocked. Each distribution center has its own fixed opening cost and a maximum supply capacity, while the cost to transport goods from these centers to the stores varies. The goal is straightforward yet daunting: to fulfill the demand of each retail store while minimizing the total operational cost, which includes both the opening of distribution centers and the transportation of goods.
