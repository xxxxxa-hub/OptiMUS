An air traffic controller needs to control the landing times of n aircrafts: Flights must land in the order 1, ..., n. Flight j must land in time interval [aj , bj ]. n = 10. [a1, b1] = [0, 60], [a2, b2] = [10, 70], [a3, b3] = [20,80], [a4, b4] = [30, 90], [a5, b5] = [40, 100], [a6, b6] = [50, 110], [a7, b7] = [60, 120], [a8, b8] = [70, 130], [a9, b9] = [80, 140], [a10, b10] = [90, 150]. The objective is to maximize the minimum separation time, which is the interval between two landings. Find the maximal minimum separation. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest time.
