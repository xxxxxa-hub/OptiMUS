A store plans to formulate the purchasing and sales plan for a certain product for the first quarter of next year. It is known that the warehouse capacity of the store can store up to 500 units of the product, and there are 200 units in stock at the end of this year. The store purchases goods once at the beginning of each month. The purchasing and selling prices of the product in each month are shown in Table 1.3.

Table 1.3

| Month | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Purchasing Price (Yuan) | 8 | 6 | 9 |
| Selling Price (Yuan) | 9 | 8 | 10 |

Now, determine how many units should be purchased and sold each month to maximize the total profit, and express this problem as a linear programming model.
