Two steel furnaces at a steel plant each use two methods of steelmaking simultaneously. The first method takes $a=2$ hours per furnace and costs $m=50$ in fuel expenses; the second method takes $b=3$ hours per furnace and costs $n=70$ in fuel expenses. Assuming each furnace produces $k=10$ tons of steel regardless of the method used, and that at least $d=30$ tons of steel must be produced within $c=12$ hours, how should these two methods be allocated to minimize fuel expenses? Formulate this problem as a linear programming model.
