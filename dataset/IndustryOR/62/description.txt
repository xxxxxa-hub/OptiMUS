A farmer needs to transport 1000 units of fresh produce from the farm to a nearby market. The farmer has three transportation options: a horse, a bicycle, and a handcart. Since both the bicycle and handcart are very physically demanding, the farmer wants to choose only one of these two transportation methods. The horse generates 80 units of pollution per trip, the bicycle generates 0 units of pollution, and the handcart generates 0 units of pollution. The total amount of pollution generated by all trips must not exceed 1000 units. At least 8 trips must be made using the horse. The horse, bicycle, and handcart can carry 55 units, 30 units, and 40 units of produce per trip respectively. The farmer needs to ensure that the total amount of transported produce is at least 1000 units. How should the farmer arrange the transportation to minimize the pollution?
