A company is producing two products (X and Y). Production is measured in standardized batches, and the weekly plan may involve fractional batches when appropriate. The resources required for X and Y are divided into two parts: machine time for automated processing and craftsman time for manual finishing. The table below shows the number of minutes required for each batch of product:

| Item | Machine Time (minutes) | Craftsman Time (minutes) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| X | 13 | 20 |
| Y | 19 | 29 |

The company has 40 hours of machine time available in the next working week, but only 35 hours of craftsman time. The cost of machine time is £10 per hour, and the cost of craftsman time is £2 per hour. Idle time for machines and craftsmen incurs no cost. For each batch produced (all batches produced will be sold), the revenue for product X is £20, and the revenue for product Y is £30. In addition, there is a contract that requires at least 10 batches of product X to be completed for a customer each week. Formulate a linear programming model to determine the weekly production plan that maximizes profit.
