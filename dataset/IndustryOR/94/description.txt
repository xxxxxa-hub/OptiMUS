A beverage factory produces a kind of beverage to meet market demand. According to market forecasts, the sales department of the factory has determined the demand for the beverage for the next 4 weeks. The planning department, based on the actual situation of the factory, has provided the production capacity and production cost for the next 4 weeks, as shown in Table 1. When there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid. How should the production plan be arranged to minimize the total cost (the sum of production cost and storage cost) over the four weeks while meeting the weekly market demand?
