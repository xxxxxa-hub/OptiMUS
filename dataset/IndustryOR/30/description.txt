A factory produces three types of products: I, II, and III. Each product must undergo two processing stages, A and B. The factory has two types of equipment to complete stage A (A1, A2) and three types of equipment to complete stage B (B1, B2, B3).

The production rules are as follows:
- Product I can be processed on any type of A equipment (A1 or A2) and any type of B equipment (B1, B2, or B3).
- Product II can be processed on any type of A equipment (A1 or A2), but for stage B, it can only be processed on B1 equipment.
- Product III can only be processed on A2 equipment for stage A and B2 equipment for stage B.

The detailed data for processing time per piece, costs, sales price, and machine availability is provided in the table below. The objective is to determine the optimal production plan to maximize the factory's total profit.
