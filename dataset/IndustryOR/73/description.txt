A project includes the following 7 activities, with their durations (in days) as follows: $A(4), B(3), C(5), D(2), E(10), F(10), G(1)$. The precedence relationships are also given as: $A \rightarrow G, D ; E, G \rightarrow F; D, F \rightarrow C ; F \rightarrow B$. The cost of work per day is 1000 Euros; additionally, a special machine must be rented from the start of activity $A$ to the end of activity $B$, costing 5000 Euros per day. Formulate this as a linear programming problem and solve it.
