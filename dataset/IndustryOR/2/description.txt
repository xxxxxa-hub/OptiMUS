A company specializing in foldable tables needs to create an optimal production and human resources plan for a six-month period (January to June) to maximize its total net profit. The plan must detail monthly in-house production levels, outsourcing quantities, and workforce management (hiring/firing).

**Initial Conditions (at the start of January):**
- Initial Workforce: 1,000 employees
- Initial Inventory: 15,000 units

**Revenue and Cost Structure:**
- **Sales Price:** 300 Yuan per unit sold.
- **Raw Material Cost:** 90 Yuan per unit, applicable *only* to units produced in-house.
- **Outsourcing Cost:** 200 Yuan per unit for finished tables acquired from a third-party supplier. This is an all-inclusive cost.
- **Inventory Holding Cost:** 15 Yuan per unit for any inventory held at the end of a month.
- **Backorder Cost:** 35 Yuan per unit for any unfulfilled demand (stockout) carried over to the next month.

**Labor and Production Parameters:**
- **Labor Requirement:** Each in-house unit requires 5 labor hours to produce.
- **Regular Labor:** Each worker provides 160 regular working hours per month (8 hours/day * 20 days/month). The company pays a regular wage of 30 Yuan/hour for these 160 hours, regardless of full utilization.
- **Overtime Labor:** Workers can perform overtime. Total overtime hours per month for the entire workforce cannot exceed 20 hours per worker. The overtime wage is 40 Yuan/hour.
- **Workforce Management:** The company can hire or fire workers each month. The cost to hire a new worker is 5,000 Yuan, and the cost to fire a worker is 8,000 Yuan.

**Demand and Fulfillment Logic:**
- Unfulfilled demand from one month is back-ordered and must be met in subsequent months.
- The company fulfills orders (both current demand and backorders) using available inventory from the previous month, current in-house production, and outsourced units.

**Terminal Condition (at the end of June):**
- The ending inventory must be at least 10,000 units.
- All backorders must be cleared (i.e., ending backorders must be zero).

**Forecasted Demand:**
| Month | January | February | March | April | May | June |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Demand Forecast | 20,000 | 40,000 | 42,000 | 35,000 | 19,000 | 18,500 |

Based on this information, formulate the optimal six-month operational plan.
