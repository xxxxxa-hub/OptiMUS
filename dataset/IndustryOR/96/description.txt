A company mixes four types of liquid raw materials with different sulfur contents (denoted as A, B, C, and D, respectively) to produce two products (denoted as \( \mathrm{A} \) and \( \mathrm{B} \)). According to the production process requirements, raw materials A, B, and D must first be mixed in a mixing tank, and then the mixed liquid is further mixed with raw material C to produce \( \mathrm{A} \) and \( \mathrm{B} \). The sulfur contents of raw materials A, B, C, and D are \( 3\%, 1\%, 2\%, 1\% \) respectively, and their purchase prices are 6, 16, 10, 15 (thousand yuan per ton) respectively. The sulfur content of products \( \mathrm{A} \) and \( \mathrm{B} \) must not exceed \( 2.5\% \) and \( 1.5\% \) respectively, and their selling prices are 9.15 (thousand yuan per ton). According to market information, there is no limit to the supply of raw materials A, B, and C, but the supply of raw material D is limited to a maximum of 50 tons. The market demand for products \( \mathrm{A} \) and \( \mathrm{B} \) is 100 tons and 200 tons respectively. How should the production be arranged to maximize the profit?
