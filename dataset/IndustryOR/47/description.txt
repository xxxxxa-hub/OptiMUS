A factory produces two models of microcomputers, A and B. Each model requires the same two processes. The processing time, sales profit, and the factory’s maximum weekly processing capacity for each model are shown in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1

| Process | Model | | Maximum Weekly Processing Capacity |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| | $A$ | $B$ | |
| I (hours/unit) | 4 | 6 | 150 |
| II (hours/unit) | 3 | 2 | 70 |
| Profit (yuan/unit) | 300 | 450 | |

Given the factory's business goals:

$p_{1}$: The total weekly profit should not be less than 10,000 yuan;

$p_{2}$: Due to contract requirements, at least 10 units of model A and at least 15 units of model B must be produced each week;

$p_{3}$: The processing time for Process I should be exactly 150 hours per week, and the processing time for Process II should ideally be fully utilized, with potential for appropriate overtime;

$p_{4}$: If products are produced during overtime in Process II, the profit per unit is reduced by 20 yuan for model A and 25 yuan for model B, and the maximum overtime for Process II is 30 hours per week. Formulate the mathematical model for this problem.
