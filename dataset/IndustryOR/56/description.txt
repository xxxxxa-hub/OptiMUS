Assuming a paper mill receives three orders for rolls of paper, with length and width requirements as shown in Table 1.2.

Table 1.2

| Order Number | Width (meters) | Length (meters) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 0.5 | 1000 |
| 2 | 0.7 | 3000 |
| 3 | 0.9 | 2000 |

The mill produces rolls of paper with standard widths of 1 meter and 2 meters. Assuming the length of the rolls is unlimited and can be spliced to reach the required length, how should the rolls be cut to minimize the area of waste?
