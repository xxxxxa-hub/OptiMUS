Tom and Jerry just bought a farm in Sunshine Valley, and they are considering using it to plant corn, wheat, soybeans, and sorghum. The profit per acre for planting corn is $1500, the profit per acre for planting wheat is $1200, the profit per acre for planting soybeans is $1800, and the profit per acre for planting sorghum is $1600. To maximize their profit, how many acres of land should they allocate to each crop? Tom and Jerry’s farm has a total area of 100 acres.

The land area used for planting corn must be at least twice the land area used for planting wheat.

The land area used for planting soybeans must be at least half the land area used for planting sorghum.

The land area used for planting wheat must be three times the land area used for planting sorghum.
