There are $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ two products, both requiring two successive chemical reaction processes. Each unit of product $\mathrm{A}$ needs 2 hours for the first process and 3 hours for the second process. Each unit of product $\mathrm{B}$ needs 3 hours for the first process and 4 hours for the second process. Available time for the first process is 16 hours, and available time for the second process is 24 hours.

For each unit of product $\mathrm{B}$ produced, 2 units of by-product $\mathrm{C}$ are generated simultaneously, requiring no additional cost. By-product $\mathrm{C}$ can be sold up to 5 units, and the rest must be disposed of at a cost of 2 yuan per unit.

Each unit of product $\mathrm{A}$ sold yields a profit of 4 yuan, each unit of product $\mathrm{B}$ yields a profit of 10 yuan, and each unit of by-product $\mathrm{C}$ sold yields a profit of 3 yuan.

In order to maximize total profit, establish the linear programming model for this problem.
