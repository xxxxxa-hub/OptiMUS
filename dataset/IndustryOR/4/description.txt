Mary is planning her dinner tonight. Every 100 grams of okra contains 3.2 grams of fiber, every 100 grams of carrots contains 2.7 grams of fiber, every 100 grams of celery contains 1.6 grams of fiber, and every 100 grams of cabbage contains 2 grams of fiber. How many grams of each type of food should Mary buy to maximize her fiber intake?

She is considering choosing one among salmon, beef, and pork as a protein source.

She also considers choosing at least two kinds of vegetables among okra, carrots, celery, and cabbage.

The price of salmon is $4 per 100 grams, beef is $3.6 per 100 grams, pork is $1.8 per 100 grams. The price of okra is $2.6 per 100 grams, carrots are $1.2 per 100 grams, celery is $1.6 per 100 grams, and cabbage is $2.3 per 100 grams. Mary has a budget of $15 for this meal.

The total food intake should be 600 grams.
