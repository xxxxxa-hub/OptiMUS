A manufacturing company needs to transport 1800 units of product from the warehouse to three different sales points. The company has four transportation options: truck, van, motorcycle, and electric vehicle. However, due to high energy consumption, the company can use either vans or electric vehicles, but not both. Each trip generates pollution: 100 units for a truck, 50 units for a van, 10 units for a motorcycle, and 0 units for an electric vehicle. The total pollution generated from all trips cannot exceed 2000 units. At least 10 trips must be made using trucks. The transport capacities per trip are 100 units (truck), 80 units (van), 40 units (motorcycle), and 60 units (electric vehicle). The goal is to plan the transportation so that at least 1800 units are delivered while minimizing the total pollution generated. What is the minimum total pollution?
