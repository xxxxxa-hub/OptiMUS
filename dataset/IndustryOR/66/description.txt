The market demand for products I and II is as follows: Product I requires 10,000 units per month from January to April, 30,000 units per month from May to September, and 100,000 units per month from October to December. Product II requires 15,000 units per month from March to September and 50,000 units per month during other months. The cost of producing these two products at a certain factory is as follows: Product I costs 5 yuan per unit to produce from January to May, and 4.50 yuan per unit from June to December; Product II costs 8 yuan per unit to produce from January to May, and 7 yuan per unit from June to December. The factory's combined production capacity for both products should not exceed 120,000 units per month. Product I has a volume of 0.2 cubic meters per unit, Product II has a volume of 0.4 cubic meters per unit, and the factory's warehouse capacity is 15,000 cubic meters. If the factory's warehouse space is insufficient, external warehouse space can be rented. Using the factory’s own warehouse costs 1 yuan per cubic meter per month, while renting an external warehouse increases this cost to 1.5 yuan per cubic meter per month. Given that the initial inventory of both products at the beginning of July is zero, how should production be scheduled from July to December to minimize the total production and inventory costs while meeting market demand?
