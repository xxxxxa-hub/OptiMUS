Given that there are $m=2$ production points for a certain type of material, where the output at the $i$-th point $(i=1,2)$ is $a_i$, $a_1 = 100$, and $a_2 = 150$. This material is to be shipped to $n=2$ demand points, where the demand at the $j$-th point $(j=1, 2)$ is $b_j$, $b_1 = 80$, and $b_2 = 120$. It is known that $\sum_i a_i \geqslant \sum_j b_j$. It is also known that when shipping from production points to demand points, it must pass through one of the $p=2$ intermediate marshaling stations. If the $k$-th $(k=1, 2)$ intermediate marshaling station is used, a fixed cost $f_k$ is incurred regardless of the transshipment volume, where $f_1 = 10$ and $f_2 = 15$. The $k$-th intermediate marshaling station has a maximum transshipment capacity limitation $q_k$, where $q_1 = 100$ and $q_2 = 100$. Let $c_{i k}$ and $c'_{k j}$ denote the unit transportation cost from $i$ to $k$ and from $k$ to $j$, respectively, where $c_{11}=2$, $c_{12}=3$, $c_{21}=4$, $c_{22}=1$, $c'_{11}=3$, $c'_{12}=2$, $c'_{21}=1$, and $c'_{22}=4$. Try to determine a transportation plan for this material that minimizes the total cost.
