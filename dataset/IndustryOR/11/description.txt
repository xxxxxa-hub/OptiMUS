Red Star Plastics Factory produces six distinct types of plastic containers. Each container type is characterized by a specific volume, market demand, and unit variable production cost, as detailed in Table 5-11.

**Table 5-11: Container Data**
| Container Type (Code)             | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6     |
| :------------------------------ | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| Volume ($\text{cm}^3$)             | 1500 | 2500 | 4000 | 6000 | 9000 | 12000 |
| Market Demand (units)           | 500  | 550  | 700  | 900  | 400  | 300   |
| Unit Variable Production Cost (Yuan/unit) | 5    | 8    | 10   | 12   | 16   | 18    |

The production of any container type necessitates the use of its dedicated specialized equipment. If the decision is made to **activate** the production equipment for a particular container type (i.e., if the production quantity of that type is greater than zero), a fixed setup cost of 1200 Yuan is incurred for that specific equipment.

Should the production quantity of a certain container type be insufficient to meet its direct demand, the factory has the option to utilize other container types with **larger or equal volume** as substitutes to fulfill this unmet demand. For instance, type 2 containers (volume 2500 $\text{cm}^3$) can be used to satisfy the demand for type 1 containers (requiring a volume of 1500 $\text{cm}^3$), but type 1 containers cannot be used for type 2 demand. In this problem, the container type codes are pre-sorted in ascending order of their volumes.

**Question:**
How should the factory organize its production? The objective is to develop a production plan that minimizes the total cost—comprising the sum of variable production costs for all containers produced and the fixed costs for all activated equipment—while ensuring that the demand for all container types is fully met.
