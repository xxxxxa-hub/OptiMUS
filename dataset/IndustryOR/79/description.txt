A company requires skilled workers and laborers for three tasks. The company must choose exactly one method to complete each task. The available methods and weekly hour requirements are:

- **Task 1 (Requires 8,400 effective hours):**
  - Method A: Completed by skilled workers alone.
  - Method B: Completed by groups of one skilled worker and two laborers. There is a fixed weekly setup cost of 500 yuan for team coordination if this method is chosen.

- **Task 2 (Requires 10,800 effective hours):**
  - Method A: Completed by skilled workers alone.
  - Method B: Completed by laborers alone.

- **Task 3 (Requires 18,000 effective hours):**
  - Method A: Completed by groups of five laborers.
  - Method B: Completed by groups of one skilled worker and three laborers.

**Wages and Hours:**
- Weekly wages: 100 yuan for skilled workers, 80 yuan for laborers.
- Effective working hours per week: 42 hours for skilled workers, 36 hours for laborers.

**Recruitment and Policy Constraints:**
1. The number of workers is limited to a maximum of 400 skilled workers and 800 laborers.
2. **Exclusion Rule:** For efficiency reasons, if Task 1 uses the mixed-group method (Method B), then Task 3 cannot use the pure laborer method (Method A).
3. **Minimum Assignment:** To ensure quality, if the mixed-group method (Method B) is chosen for Task 3, a minimum of 20 skilled workers must be assigned to it.
4. **Hiring Policy:** The total number of skilled workers hired cannot exceed 60% of the total number of laborers hired.

Establish a mathematical model to determine which method to choose for each task and how many workers of each type to hire to minimize the total weekly cost (wages + fixed costs).
