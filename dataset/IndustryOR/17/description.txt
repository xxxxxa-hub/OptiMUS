A textile factory produces two types of fabrics: one for clothing and the other for curtains. The factory operates two shifts, with a weekly production time set at 110 hours. Both types of fabrics are produced at a rate of 1000 meters per hour. Assuming that at least 70,000 meters of curtain fabric can be sold per week, with a profit of 2.5 yuan per meter, and at least 45,000 meters of clothing fabric can be sold per week, with a profit of 1.5 yuan per meter, the factory has the following objectives in formulating its production plan:

$p_{1}$ : The weekly production time must fully utilize 110 hours;

$p_{2}$ : Overtime should not exceed 10 hours per week;

$p_{3}$ : At least 70,000 meters of curtain fabric and 45,000 meters of clothing fabric must be sold per week;

$p_{4}$ : Minimize overtime as much as possible.
