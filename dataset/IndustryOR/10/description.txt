A company produces two types of small motorcycles. Type A is entirely manufactured in-house, while Type B is assembled from imported parts. The time required per unit for manufacturing, assembly, and inspection is shown in Table 3.2. The weekly available capacity of each process is also listed. Each process has an hourly cost, and the selling price per unit of each product is given.

Table 3.2

| Type | Manufacturing (hours/unit) | Assembly (hours/unit) | Inspection (hours/unit) | Selling Price (Yuan/unit) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Type A | 20 | 5 | 3 | 650 |
| Type B | 0 | 7 | 6 | 725 |
| Max weekly capacity | 120 | 80 | 40 | - |
| Process cost (Yuan/hour) | 12 | 8 | 10 | - |

Let decision variables \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) denote the weekly production quantities of Type A and Type B, respectively. The company's operational requirements are as follows:

- \(p_{1}\): The total weekly profit should be at least 3000 yuan.
- \(p_{2}\): At least 5 units of Type A must be produced each week.
- \(p_{3}\): Idle time of each process should be minimized, with weights proportional to the corresponding hourly cost. Overtime is not allowed.

Formulate a linear programming model to maximize weekly profit subject to these constraints. What is the total profit of the company’s production plan that satisfies the goals and targets above?
