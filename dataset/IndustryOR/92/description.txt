A dairy processing plant uses milk to produce two dairy products, \( A_{1} \) and \( A_{2} \). One barrel of milk can be processed into 3 kg of \( A_{1} \) in 12 hours on Type A equipment or into 4 kg of \( A_{2} \) in 8 hours on Type B equipment. According to market demand, all produced \( A_{1} \) and \( A_{2} \) can be sold. The profit is 24 yuan per kilogram of \( A_{1} \) and 16 yuan per kilogram of \( A_{2} \). The processing plant can get a daily supply of 50 barrels of milk, with a total of 480 hours of labor time available from regular workers each day. The Type A equipment can process up to 100 kg of \( A_{1} \) per day, while the processing capacity of Type B equipment is not limited. Formulate a production plan for the plant to maximize daily profit.
