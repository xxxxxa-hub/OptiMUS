Mary is planning tonight's dinner. She wants to choose a combination of protein and vegetables to maximize her protein intake for the meal. Her protein options are chicken, salmon, and tofu, which can be bought in any quantity.

- Chicken: 23g protein, $3.00 cost, per 100g.
- Salmon: 20g protein, $5.00 cost, per 100g.
- Tofu: 8g protein, $1.50 cost, per 100g.

She also wants to choose from a list of five vegetables, sold in 100g packs. She must select at least three different types of vegetables.

- Broccoli (100g pack): 2.8g protein, $1.20 cost.
- Carrots (100g pack): 0.9g protein, $0.80 cost.
- Spinach (100g pack): 2.9g protein, $1.50 cost.
- Bell Pepper (100g pack): 1.0g protein, $1.00 cost.
- Mushrooms (100g pack): 3.1g protein, $2.00 cost.

Mary has two main constraints:
1. Her total budget is $20.
2. The total weight of all food must not exceed 800 grams.

How should Mary choose her ingredients to get the maximum possible amount of protein?
