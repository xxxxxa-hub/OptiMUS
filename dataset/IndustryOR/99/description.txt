In network communication services, bandwidth plays an important role. Below is a bandwidth communication table between several communication nodes, showing the bandwidth between any two nodes. If two nodes cannot be directly connected, the corresponding bandwidth is $0$. It is required to establish a link between node $A$ and node $E$ that must pass through service node $C$ (without loops). The bandwidth of this link is defined as the minimum bandwidth value on the link. Please propose a reasonable link arrangement to maximize the bandwidth of this link and find out the maximum bandwidth.
