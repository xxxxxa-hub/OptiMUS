A convenience supermarket is planning to open several chain stores in a newly built residential area in the northwest suburb of the city. For shopping convenience, the distance from any residential area to one of the chain stores should not exceed $800 \mathrm{~m}$. Table 5-1 shows the new residential areas and the residential areas within a radius of $800 \mathrm{~m}$ from each of them. Question: What is the minimum number of chain stores the supermarket needs to build among the mentioned residential areas, and in which residential areas should they be built?
