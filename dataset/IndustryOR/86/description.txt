A transportation company has two types of trucks, Type A and Type B. Type A trucks have 20 cubic meters of refrigerated capacity and 40 cubic meters of non-refrigerated capacity. In contrast, Type B trucks have the same total capacity, but the capacities for refrigerated and non-refrigerated cargo are equal. A grocer needs to rent trucks to transport 3000 cubic meters of refrigerated cargo and 4000 cubic meters of non-refrigerated cargo. The rental cost per kilometer for Type A trucks is £30, while the rental cost per kilometer for Type B trucks is £40. How many of each type of truck should the grocer rent to minimize the total cost?
