Healthy Pet Foods Company produces two types of dog food: Meaties and Yummies. Each pack of Meaties contains 2 pounds of grains and 3 pounds of meat; each pack of Yummies contains 3 pounds of grains and 1.5 pounds of meat. The company believes it can sell any quantity of dog food that it can produce. Meaties sell for $2.80 per pack, and Yummies sell for $2.00 per pack. The company's production is subject to several constraints. First, a maximum of 400,000 pounds of grains can be purchased each month at a price of $0.20 per pound of grains. A maximum of 300,000 pounds of meat can be purchased each month at a price of $0.50 per pound of meat. Additionally, a special machine is required to produce Meaties, with a monthly capacity of 90,000 packs. The variable costs for mixing and packaging dog food are $0.25 per pack (Meaties) and $0.20 per pack (Yummies). Detailed information is provided in Table B-1.
