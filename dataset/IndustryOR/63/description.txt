A company needs to decide whether to hire some of the five candidates to join their R&D team. The salary requirements for candidates F, G, H, I, and J are $12,000, $15,000, $18,000, $5,000, and $10,000 respectively. The company wants to minimize the total amount paid to candidates without exceeding the budget.

The company's budget is $40,000 and they wish to hire a maximum of 4 new employees.

The skill levels of the candidates are as follows:
Candidate F: Level 2
Candidate G: Level 3
Candidate H: Level 4
Candidate I: Level 1
Candidate J: Level 2

The company needs to ensure that the total skill level of the hired employees is at least 8.

The project management experience years of each candidate are as follows:
Candidate F: 1 year
Candidate G: 2 years
Candidate H: 2 years
Candidate I: 5 years
Candidate J: 4 years

They hope the total project management experience of the team is at least 8 years.

Due to the similar technical background of candidates G and J, the company can choose at most one of them.
