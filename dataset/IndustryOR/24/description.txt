An investor plans to invest 100,000 yuan, with two investment options to choose from. The first investment guarantees a return of 0.7 yuan for every 1 yuan invested after one year. The second investment guarantees a return of 2 yuan for every 1 yuan invested after two years, but the investment time must be in multiples of two years. In order to maximize the investor's earnings by the end of the third year, how should the investments be made? Formulate this as a linear programming problem.
