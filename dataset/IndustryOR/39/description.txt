The independent country of Carelland mainly exports four commodities: steel, engines, electronic components, and plastic. Carelland's Minister of Finance (i.e., Minister of Economy) wants to maximize exports and minimize imports. The unit prices of steel, engines, electronics, and plastic on the world market are, in local currency (Klunz), 500, 1500, 300, 1200 respectively. Producing 1 unit of steel requires 0.02 units of engines, 0.01 units of plastic, 250 Klunz of other imported goods, and 6 person-months of labor. Producing 1 unit of engines requires 0.8 units of steel, 0.15 units of electronic components, 0.11 units of plastic, 300 Klunz of imported goods, and 1 person-year. One unit of electronics requires: 0.01 units of steel, 0.01 units of engines, 0.05 units of plastic, 50 Klunz of imported goods, and 6 person-months of labor. One unit of plastic requires: 0.03 units of engines, 0.2 units of steel, 0.05 units of electronic components, 300 Klunz of imported goods, and 2 person-years. Engine production is limited to 650000 units, and plastic production is limited to 60000 units. The total available labor force per year is 830000 person-months.
