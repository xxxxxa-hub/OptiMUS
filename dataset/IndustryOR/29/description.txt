Suppose a certain animal needs at least $700 \mathrm{~g}$ of protein, $30 \mathrm{~g}$ of minerals, and $100 \mathrm{mg}$ of vitamins daily. There are 5 types of feed available, and the nutritional content and price per gram of each type of feed are shown in Table 1-5:
Try to formulate a linear programming model that meets the animal's growth needs while minimizing the cost of selecting the feed.
