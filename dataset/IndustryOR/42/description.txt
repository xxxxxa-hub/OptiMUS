A production base needs to extract raw materials from warehouses A and B every day for production. The required raw materials are: at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, and at least 120 tons of raw material C. It is known that: Each truck from warehouse A can transport back to the production base 4 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 6 tons of raw material C, with a freight cost of 200 yuan per truck; each truck from warehouse B can transport back to the production base 7 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 2 tons of raw material C per day, with a freight cost of 160 yuan per truck. Question: In order to meet production needs, how many trucks should be dispatched daily from warehouse A and warehouse B to minimize the total freight cost?
