A timber storage and transport company has a large warehouse for storing and transporting timber for sale. Due to seasonal price fluctuations, the company purchases timber at the beginning of each quarter, with part of it being sold within the quarter and part being stored for future sales. It is known that the maximum storage capacity of the company’s warehouse is 200,000 m³, and the storage cost is $(a+b u)$ yuan/m³, where $a=70$, $b=100$, and $u$ is the storage time (in quarters). The purchase and sale prices for each quarter and the estimated maximum sales volumes are shown in Table 1-18.

Since timber is not suitable for long-term storage, all inventory should be sold by the end of autumn. Try to establish a linear programming model for this problem to maximize the company's annual profit.
