A company produces two products (A and B), with a profit of £3 and £5 per unit sold, respectively. Each product must be assembled on a specific machine, requiring 12 minutes of assembly time per unit for product A and 25 minutes per unit for product B. The company's estimated effective machine working time per week is only 30 hours (due to maintenance or malfunctions). Technical constraints mean that for every five units of product A produced, at least two units of product B must be produced.
