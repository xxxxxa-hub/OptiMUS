A real estate developer is planning to allocate budget across three types of projects: Residential ($X$), Commercial ($Y$) and Industrial ($Z$). The total number of projects that can be undertaken is limited to 50 due to capacity constraints. The minimum number of residential, commercial and industrial projects that need to be undertaken are 10, 15 and 5 respectively due to market demand. Additionally, the developer needs to ensure that the combined count of twice the residential projects minus the commercial projects plus the industrial ones is at least 20 in order to maintain a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe costs associated with each type of project are $\$10000$, $\$8000$ and $\$6000$ for residential, commercial and industrial respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all project counts are whole numbers due to their indivisible nature.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario in dollars, rounded off to the nearest dollar?
