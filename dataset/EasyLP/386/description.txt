A tourism agency is planning to allocate resources to four different tours: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These tours could involve different destinations with varying costs associated with them. The objective is to minimize the total cost while ensuring certain constraints related to budget and customer demand are met. The costs for each tour are as follows: 50 units for x1, 100 units for x2, 70 units for x3, and 120 units for x4.\n\nThe resource allocation must adhere to the following constraints:- The combined number of tours offered in categories x1 and x2 cannot exceed 500 due to limited resources.- Similarly, the combined number of tours offered in categories x3 and x4 cannot exceed 300 due to logistical restrictions.- To meet a specific demand threshold, twice the number of tours offered in category x1 plus four times those in category x2 must be at least 400.- Likewise, thrice the number of tours offered in category x3 plus twice those in category X4 should be at least 250.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering that the number of tours must be whole numbers due to practical considerations (you can't offer a fraction of a tour), what is the minimum total cost for the agency given an optimal allocation of resources across all four tour categories within their specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole unit.
