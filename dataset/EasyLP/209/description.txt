In a healthcare scenario, a hospital administrator is planning to allocate funds across three departments: X (General Medicine), Y (Pediatrics), and Z (Surgery). These allocations need to be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. The total budget for all three departments combined cannot exceed \$1000 due to financial constraints. Department X requires an allocation that is at least \$200 more than twice the allocation for department Y, while department Z requires an allocation that exceeds the allocation for department Y by at least \$150.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of each dollar spent in these departments varies, with one unit of resource yielding different returns or costs quantified as 50 units for department X, 30 units for department Y, and 20 units for department Z. The hospital aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these allocation constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that each department has specific bounds on fund allocation: What is the minimum total cost required given optimal fund distribution among departments X, Y, and Z within their respective bounds? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
