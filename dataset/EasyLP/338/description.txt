A manufacturing company is planning to produce four types of products: $X1, X2, X3,$ and $X4$. The objective is to minimize the total production cost, with costs being $\$5$, $\$10$, $\$20$, and $\$25$ per unit for $X1, X2, X3,$ and $X4$ respectively.\n\nThe production must adhere to the following constraints due to raw material availability and production capacity:- The combined number of units for products $X1$ and $X2$ cannot exceed 100.- For every 2 units of product $X3$ produced, 3 units of product $X4$ can be made within a maximum limit of 200 units.- The number of units for product $X1$, minus twice the number of units for product $X2$, plus the number of units for product $X3$ must be at least 50. This could reflect a strategic decision or market demand.- The difference between the numbers of products made for type-$x_2,x_3$, subtracted from type-$x_1$, should not exceed 70.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of products due to practicality in manufacturing process. Also each type has specific bounds on how many can be produced:What is the minimum total cost for producing these items, given that we want an optimal allocation strategy within specified limits? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest dollar.
