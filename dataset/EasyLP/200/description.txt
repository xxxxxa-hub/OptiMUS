A financial advisor is planning the allocation of funds across three different investment portfolios: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These portfolios could represent investments in different sectors such as technology, real estate, and energy. The total investment across all three portfolios cannot exceed \$10000 due to budget constraints. Portfolio $X$ requires a minimum investment of \$200 to be viable with a maximum limit of \$5000, while portfolio $Y$ has a minimum allowable investment of \$100 with a maximum limit of \$4000 due to regulatory or physical limitations. Portfolio $Z$, on the other hand, requires a minimum investment of \$800, possibly due to its larger scale or higher initial setup costs.\n\nIn addition to these constraints, the following conditions must also be met:\n- The combined returns from 7\\% return on portfolio X minus 2\\% loss on portfolio Y and 5\\% loss on portfolio Z must not be negative.\n- The difference between the investments in portfolio X and twice that in portfolio Y plus the amount invested in Z should be at least \$3000.\n\nEach unit of investment in portfolios $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs (such as management fees or transaction costs), quantified as \$50 , \$30 , and \$20 per dollar invested respectively. The financial advisor aims to minimize these total costs while adhering to all the above constraints and ensuring that all investments are in whole dollars due to the indivisible nature of currency units. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario.
