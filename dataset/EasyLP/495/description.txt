A shipping company is planning to allocate its fleet of trucks between two major routes: route X and route Y. The total capacity of the trucks assigned to twice route X combined with three times route Y cannot exceed 500 units due to highway weight restrictions. However, the company must also ensure that the total number of trucks on both routes is at least 100 in order to meet customer demand. Additionally, the difference in truck numbers between routes X and Y should not be more than 50 to maintain a balanced service level across all regions.\n\nThe cost per trip for a truck on route X is 4 units and for route Y it's 6 units. The company aims to minimize its overall transportation cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of trucks allocated are whole numbers due to operational practicalities.\n\nGiven these conditions, what would be the minimum total transportation cost (in unit costs), given an optimal allocation of trucks? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
