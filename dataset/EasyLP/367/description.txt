A construction company is planning to allocate its workforce to four different projects: P1, P2, P3, and P4. The cost per worker for each project are $\$1000$, $\$2000$, $\$3000$, and $\$4000$, respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limits, manpower availability, and project requirements:\n- The combined number of workers on projects P1 and P2 cannot exceed 20.\n- The total number of workers on projects P2 and P3 must be at least 10.\n- The difference in the number of workers between projects P3 and P4 should not exceed 5.\n- Twice the number of workers on project P1 plus thrice that on project P2 minus the ones working on project P4 should be at least 15.\n\nAdditionally, each project has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nP1 can have a maximum of 10 workers,\nP2 can have up to 15,\nP3 is limited to 12,\nand a maximum of 8 workers can be assigned to Project P4. \nThe numbers need to be whole as you cannot assign fractional parts of a worker.\nThe company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. What is the minimum total cost for optimal workforce allocation across all four projects? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest dollar.
