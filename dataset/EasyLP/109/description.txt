A sports team coach is planning to divide training time between two key exercises: $X$ and $Y$. Each exercise requires a certain amount of time, represented by the variables $x$ and $y$, respectively. The total training time for both exercises must be at least 15 hours to ensure sufficient conditioning for the team. However, due to facility constraints, twice the time spent on exercise X plus the time on exercise Y cannot exceed 40 hours.\n\nThe cost of each hour of training for exercise X is \$20, while it's \$30 for exercise Y. The coach wants to minimize the total cost of conducting these trainings while meeting all requirements and considering that the time assigned for each exercise can only be in whole hours.\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost in dollars (rounded to nearest dollar) that can be achieved under these conditions?
