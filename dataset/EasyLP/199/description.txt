A financial advisor is managing a portfolio and plans to invest in three different assets: X, Y, and Z. The total investment across all three assets cannot exceed \$1000 due to budget constraints. Asset X requires a minimum investment of \$200 to be viable, while asset Y requires at least \$150. For asset Z, the minimum investment required is \$250 due to its higher risk and potential return. Each unit of investment in assets X, Y, and Z yields different returns or costs, quantified as \$500 , \$300 , and \$700 respectively. The financial advisor aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to the investment constraints for each asset (X,Y,Z are integers). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar.
