A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources across four different projects: X1, X2, X3, and X4. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, improving data security and implementing new technologies respectively. Each project has a different cost per unit of resource allocated: 1000 for project X1, 2000 for project X2, 3000 for project X3 and 4000 for project X4. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to certain constraints due to budget limitations and strategic objectives.\n\nThe combined resources allocated to projects X1 and X2 cannot exceed 500 units. Similarly, the combined resources allocated to projects X3 and X4 cannot exceed 800 units.\n\nTo ensure a balanced approach in resource allocation, half of the resources allocated to project X1 must be at least one-fourth more than those allocated to Project X3 by no less than 50 units.\n\nFurthermore, the difference between three-quarters of the resources allocated to Project X4 and those assigned to Project X2 must be at least 100 units.\n\nAll resource allocations are integer numbers due to the indivisible nature of these resources (e.g., personnel or equipment). Additionally, each project has specific bounds on how many resources it can absorb effectively:\n- For Project x1: between 0 and 500 units,\n- For Project x2: between 0 and 400 units,\n- For Project x3: between 0 and 600 units,\n- For Project x4: between 0 and 700 units.\n\nGiven all these conditions:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars that would allow this telecommunications company to fulfill its objectives while respecting all these constraints? Please provide your answer rounded up to nearest whole number.
