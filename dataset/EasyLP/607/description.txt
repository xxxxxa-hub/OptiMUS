A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources across four different projects: $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, and $X_4$. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, improving data security, and implementing new technologies respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects. The costs associated with each unit of resource for projects $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ and $X_4$ are 0.5, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for project $X_1$ and project $X_2$ should not exceed 5000 units.\n- Resource allocated for project $X_2$ must be at least by a thousand more than that of project X3.\n- Project X3's resource along with twice that of project X4 should not exceed 3000 units.\n- Resources dedicated to project X4 must be at least by a hundred more than those dedicated to project X1.\n\nEach project also has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nProject X1: [0 - 2000]\nProject X2: [0 -1500]\nProject X3: [500 -1500]\nProject X4: [500 -2000]\nThe allocations for all projects are required to be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources being allocated.\nThe question is:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for the company (in thousands), given these constraints, rounded off to one decimal place?
