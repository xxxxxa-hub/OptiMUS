In an education setting, a school needs to allocate resources between two types of educational activities, X and Y. These could represent different subjects or teaching methods. The total number of hours that can be allocated is limited to 10 due to scheduling constraints. To meet the learning objectives, the combined effort of these activities, quantified as 5 times the hours for activity X plus 6 times the hours for activity Y, must be at least 20. Each hour spent on activities X and Y requires 2 and 3 units of resources respectively, and the school aims to minimize the total resource usage while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of hours for both X and Y are integers. Calculate the minimum total resource usage required for this schedule, rounded to the nearest whole number.
