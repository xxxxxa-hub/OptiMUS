An energy company is planning to produce power using three sources: coal, gas, and nuclear. The total power produced by all three sources must be at least 1000 units to meet the demand. However, due to environmental regulations and operational constraints, the production of power from 3 units of coal minus the production from gas cannot exceed 500 units. Additionally, the production from nuclear must be at least 200 units more than twice the production from gas.\n\nEach unit of power produced by coal, gas, and nuclear costs $50$, $40$, and $60$ respectively. The company aims to minimize its total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all productions are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer in dollars rounded off to nearest whole number.
