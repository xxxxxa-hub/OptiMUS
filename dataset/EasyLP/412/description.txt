A real estate developer is planning to allocate resources across four different projects: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These projects could represent investments in residential, commercial, industrial, and infrastructural developments respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects. The costs per unit of investment for the projects $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$ are \$200, \$300, \$400 and \$500 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for residential and commercial development (projects $x1$ and $x2$) cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The allocation for twice the industrial development plus infrastructure development (2*$x3$ + $x4$) cannot exceed 1200 units.\n- The sum of all allocations ($x1 + x2 + x3 + x4$) should be at least 500 units indicating a minimum level of overall activity.\n\nGiven that each project has specific bounds on resource allocation due to various factors such as regulatory requirements or market conditions:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for the company, given an optimal allocation of resources within these bounds? Note that all allocations are whole numbers due to indivisibility in real-world resources. Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
