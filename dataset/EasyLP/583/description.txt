A marketing manager is planning the distribution of the budget between four advertising channels for an upcoming campaign: Online Advertising (Online_Ad), Offline Advertising (Offline_Ad), Social Media Advertising (Social_Media_Ad) and Email Marketing (Email_Marketing). The total budget for both Online_Ad and Offline_Ad combined is constrained to a maximum of 5000 units, while that for Social_Media_Ad and Email_Marketing cannot exceed 3000 units. Furthermore, in order to meet specific marketing strategy requirements, the investment in Online_Ad should be at least 1000 units more than that in Offline_Ad, while the allocation for Social_Media_Ad should exceed that for Email_Marketing by at least 500 units. Each channel has its own cost per unit effectiveness: \$20 for Online_Ad, \$30 for Offline_Ad, \$10 for Social_Media_ad and \$15 for Email_Marketing. Additionally, there are specific bounds on resource allocation due to operational constraints: each of the channels can receive up to certain number of units with Online_ad not exceeding 3000, offline ad not exceeding 2000 and both social media ad and email marketing not exceeding 1500 each. Given these conditions and aiming at whole numbers due to budgeting practicalities, what is the minimum total cost in dollars to achieve all these objectives given optimal allocations? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
