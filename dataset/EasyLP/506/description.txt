A marketing manager is planning a campaign and has three options to distribute the budget: online marketing, offline marketing, and event marketing. The costs per unit of effectiveness for each channel are $\$50$, $\$70$, and $\$90$ respectively. The total effort across all channels must be at least 1000 units to ensure sufficient market coverage.\n\nHowever, there are several constraints:\n- To maintain a balanced approach, the difference between the effort put into online marketing and half of that in offline marketing cannot exceed 500 units.\n- Offline marketing requires more emphasis than event marketing by at least 200 units due to its wider reach.\n- Additionally, the combined efforts of online and event marketing cannot exceed 1200 units due to logistical limitations.\n\nMoreover, due to resource restrictions or strategic considerations, each channel has specific bounds on investment: Online Marketing can range from $0 - \$800$, Offline Marketing from $0 - \$700$, and Event Marketing from $0 - \$600$. \n\nAll these figures must be integers because you cannot have fractions of a unit when it comes to real-world execution.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum cost required for this campaign (rounded off to the nearest dollar) if we aim for optimal distribution while adhering strictly to all given constraints?
