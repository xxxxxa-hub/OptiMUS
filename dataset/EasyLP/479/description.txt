An education department is planning the allocation of resources for an upcoming academic year. The department needs to allocate teachers and classrooms to maximize efficiency while minimizing cost. Each teacher costs \$5000, and each classroom costs \$3000 per year. The number of allocated teachers and classrooms should be integers due to the nature of these resources.\n\nThe department has determined that there must always be at least as many teachers as there are classrooms, ensuring that every classroom has a dedicated teacher. Additionally, in order to maintain high teaching quality and small class sizes, the total number of teachers multiplied by 30 minus the number of classrooms should not be less than zero. Furthermore, they have set a minimum requirement such that 20 times the number of teachers plus the number of classrooms must be at least 100.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total annual cost for this resource allocation plan? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
