An energy company is planning to allocate resources across four different projects: $X1, X2, X3$, and $X4$. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. Each project has a unique cost associated with it per unit of investment: Project $X1$ costs 60 units, Project $X2$ costs 50 units, Project $X3$ costs 70 units, and Project $X4$ costs 80 units.\n\nThe company has the following constraints on its resource allocation:\n- The total investment in Projects $X1$ and $X2$ cannot exceed 500 units due to budget limitations.\n- Similarly, the total investment in Projects $X3$ and $X4$ cannot exceed 300 units because of technical constraints.\n- To achieve diversity in their portfolio, the company wants the combined investment in Projects $X1$ and $X3$ to be at least 200 units.\n- Additionally, the difference between the resources allocated to Project $X2$ and half of those allocated to Project $X4$ must be at least 100 units due to strategic considerations.\n\nEach project also has specific bounds on resource allocation due to logistical or regulatory reasons. For instance:\n- The investment in Project $X1$ must be between 0 and 400 inclusive.\n- The investment in Project $X2$ should range from 0 to a maximum of 350 inclusive.\n- For Project X3, this range is from zero up to a maximum of 250 inclusive while for project X4 it's from zero up to a maximum of150 inclusive\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that all investments are made as whole numbers (due to the indivisible nature of certain resources), what would be the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
