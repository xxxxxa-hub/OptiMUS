In a military operation, the commander needs to allocate resources among three different types of units: $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. The allocation has to be in whole numbers due to the nature of the resources. To meet strategic objectives, the combined effort from all three units must satisfy certain conditions: \n- The sum of allocations for unit $X$, twice that for unit $Y$, and unit $Z$ should be at least 100.\n- Twice the allocation for unit $X$ plus that for unit $Y$ cannot exceed 200.\n- The difference between allocations for unit $X$ and unit $Z$ should not exceed 50.\nEach type of unit requires different amounts of support points per allocated resource with 5 points required for unit X, 6 points required for unit Y, and 4 points required for Unit Z. \nThe objective is to minimize total support points while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total support points required (rounded to nearest whole number).
