A retail manager is planning to allocate the annual budget across four different online marketing channels: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These could represent investments in social media advertising, email marketing, SEO optimization, and content marketing, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these channels, with costs being 2 units for $x1$, 3 units for $x2$, 4 units for $x3$ and 5 units for $x4$.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic considerations:\n- The combined budget allocation for channels $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- To ensure a balanced strategy, the sum of allocations for channels $x2$ and $x3$ should be at least 500 units.\n- The allocation for channel $x3$, minus half of the allocation for channel $x4$, should not exceed 200 units - this could reflect certain synergies or dependencies between these two channels.\n- Channel $x1$ must have an allocation that is no less than seventy percent of channel's$x4$ - this might be due to established success metrics or contractual obligations.\n- Lastly,the difference between eighty percent of channel's$x2$'s allocation plus that of channel's$x3$',minus that of channel's$x1'$ should not exceed 70 units - reflecting specific campaign requirements.\n\nGiven these conditions (and considering all allocations are integers), along with each channel having specific upper bounds on resource allocation: What is the minimum total cost required to meet all these constraints while optimizing online marketing efforts?
