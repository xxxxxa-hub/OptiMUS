An environmental protection agency is planning to allocate its resources across four projects: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These projects could involve air pollution control, water treatment, waste management, and renewable energy development, respectively. The objective of the agency is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects while ensuring all objectives are met. The costs per unit resource for projects $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$ are 0.5 units, 0.3 units, 0.4 units and 0.6 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and specific project requirements:\n- The combined resources allocated for projects $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 500 units.\n- Twice the resources allocated for project $x1$ plus thrice that for project $x3$ must be at least 300 units in order to ensure effective implementation.\n- Resources allocated for project $x4$ should not exceed half of those allocated for project $x2$ by more than 100 units.\n- The difference between resources allocated for project $x2$, plus those for project x4, minus those assigned to projects x1 and x3 must be exactly equal to 80 units.\n\nEach project has a minimum and maximum limit on resource allocation which needs to be respected:\n$x1$: [0 ,400]\n$x2$: [0 ,300]\n$x3$: [50 ,200]\n$x4$: [30 ,60].\n\nGiven that all allocations have to be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of some resources involved in each project,\nThe question is: What would be the minimum total cost (rounded off) associated with allocating resources optimally across these four environmental protection projects?
