A telecommunications company is managing two key projects: Project X and Project Y. The company aims to minimize the total cost of these projects, with the costs associated with each unit of resources allocated being \$20 for project X and \$30 for project Y. Both the allocation amounts must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of certain resources.\n\nThe resource allocation must meet these operational constraints:\n- To ensure sufficient progress, five times the resources allocated to Project X combined with three times that of Project Y should at least be 60 units.\n- To manage workload and avoid over-commitment, four times the resources allocated to Project X along with those for Project Y should not exceed 80 units.\n- To maintain a strategic focus on key initiatives, the difference in resource allocation between Projects X and Y needs to be at least 10 units in favor of Project X.\n\nGiven that there are specific bounds on resource allocation (between 0 and 1000 units for project X and between 0 and 500 units for project Y), what is the minimum total cost in dollars for optimal resource allocation across both projects, rounded to nearest dollar?
