A shipping company needs to allocate their resources among three routes: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These routes could represent different geographical regions or types of cargo. The total resource allocation across all three routes cannot exceed 100 units due to the limited capacity of their fleet. To ensure a balanced service coverage, the allocation for route X must be at least 10 units more than that for route Y. Additionally, the combined resource allocation for routes Y and Z cannot exceed 70 units because of time constraints on these particular routes. Each unit of resource allocated to routes $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs of 5 , 3 , and 4 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated (like trucks or crew members). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number.
