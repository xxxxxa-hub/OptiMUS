A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent investments in different technologies or infrastructures. The total resource allocation for both projects $X$ and $Y$ must be at least 1000 units due to the minimum requirement for these projects. Moreover, the difference between the resources allocated to project $Y$ and project $Z$ cannot exceed 500 units to maintain a balanced portfolio. Furthermore, the combined resource allocation for projects $X$ and $Z$ must equal exactly 1500 units, possibly due to some specific strategic objectives.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource allocation differs across projects, being 8 units for project X, 5 units for project Y, and 2 units for project Z. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to all constraints. Given that the resource allocations are in whole numbers due to indivisibility of resources, what is the minimum total cost in terms of unit costs that this company can achieve by optimally allocating its resources across these three projects? Please provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
