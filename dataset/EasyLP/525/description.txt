A healthcare manager needs to allocate resources between three departments: $X$ for patient care, $Y$ for research and development, and $Z$ for administrative tasks. The allocation must be in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources. The total resource allocation for patient care (department X) and research and development (department Y) cannot exceed 150 units due to budget constraints. To maintain an efficient operation, the combined resources allocated to patient care (department X) and administrative tasks (department Z) must be at least 100 units. In addition, the difference in resource allocation between research and development (department Y) and administrative tasks (department Z) should not exceed 60 units to ensure a balanced focus on both areas. Furthermore, department X should not receive more than 10 units less than what is allocated to department Z to maintain service quality.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated incurs different costs across departments: $\$50$ per unit for department $X$, $\$80$ per unit for department $Y$, and $\$30$ per unit for department $Z$. Given these conditions, what is the minimum total cost in dollars that the healthcare manager can achieve while meeting all constraints? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
