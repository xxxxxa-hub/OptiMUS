In a military operation, the commander needs to allocate resources across four units: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$. These could represent different types of units such as infantry, tanks, aircraft and naval forces. The commander aims to minimize the total cost associated with these units where costs are 300, 200, 500 and 400 units for $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to operational requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for unit $x1$ and unit $x2$ cannot exceed 1000.\n- Twice the resources allocated to unit $x1$ along with those allocated to unit $x3$ should be at least 800 - this reflects their critical importance in the mission.\n- Resources allocated to unit $x2$ minus half of those allocated to unit $x4$ must be no less than 300 - possibly due to specific deployment strategies.\n- The difference between resources allocated for units x2 and x3, when reduced by resources assigned to x1, should not exceed 70 - ensuring a balanced force composition.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of resource allocations due to logistical practicalities (each type of resource is indivisible), calculate the minimum total cost required for this operation given optimal allocation across all four units within specified bounds. Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
