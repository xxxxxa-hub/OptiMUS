A sports club manager is planning to allocate resources to three different areas: x1 represents strength conditioning, x2 represents skill development, and x3 represents strategy and tactics. The objective is to minimize the total fatigue score, which is affected by the intensity and duration of each area. The fatigue scores associated with each unit of effort are 2 for strength conditioning (x1), 3 for skill development (x2), and 5 for strategy and tactics (x3).\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to time limitations and balance in training:\n- The combined effort on strength conditioning (x1) and skill development (x2) cannot exceed 10 units.\n- Four times the effort on strength conditioning (x1) along with five times that on strategy and tactics (x3) should be at least 20 units, reflecting specific training requirements.\n- The difference between efforts allocated to strategy and tactics (x3) and those dedicated to skill development(x2), must not exceed 5 units, ensuring balanced training focus.\n- The effort dedicated towards strategy and tactics(x3) should always be more than or equal half of that spent on strength conditioning(x1). \n\nGiven these conditions along with a requirement that the allocations for x1, x2, x3 must be whole numbers due to practical scheduling considerations:\nWhat is the minimum total fatigue score possible given these constraints? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
