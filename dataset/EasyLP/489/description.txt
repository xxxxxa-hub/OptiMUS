In a military operation, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units, $X$ and $Y$. The number of unit $X$ cannot exceed 20 due to logistical constraints, while the maximum number of unit $Y$ is 15. To achieve an objective, the combined strength measured by a certain metric for 10 units of $X$ and 15 units of $Y$ must be at least 100. In addition, the combined strength for another metric for 20 units of $X$ and 30 units of $Y$ must not exceed 200. Moreover, there should be at least 10 more unit X than unit Y because they have different roles in this operation. Each unit of type $X$ requires $\$5000$, and each unit of type $Y$ requires $\$7000$. The commander aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of units for both X and Y are integers. What is the minimum total cost required for this operation? Provide your answer in dollars rounded to nearest dollar.
