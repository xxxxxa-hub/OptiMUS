An agricultural manager is planning the allocation of resources between three crops: X, Y and Z. The total amount of resources allocated to crop X and Y combined cannot exceed 1000 units due to land constraints. Similarly, the combination of crop Y and Z cannot exceed 800 units because of water supply limitations. To ensure a diverse yield, the combined resources for crop X and Z must be at least 500 units. Additionally, to maintain balance in soil nutrients, the difference between resources allocated to crop X and Y should not exceed 200 units.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit resource for crops X, Y and Z are $20$, $30$ and $10$ respectively. The aim is to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints (X,Y,Z are integers). What is the minimum total cost in dollars when allocating resources optimally across these three crops? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
