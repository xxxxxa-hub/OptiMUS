A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, improving data security, and implementing new technologies respectively. The cost associated with these projects are \$50 per unit for project $x1$, \$60 per unit for project $x2$, \$30 per unit for project $x3$ and \$40 per unit for project $x4$.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 5000 units.\n- The combined resource allocation for $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 2000 units.\n- The difference between the allocations of resources in project $x1$ and project $x2$ should be at least 1000 units.\n- The difference between the allocations of resources in project $x3$ and project $x4$ should not exceed 500 units.\n\nAlso each of the four projects has specific bounds on resource allocation i.e.,\n$x1$: [0,3000]\n$x2$: [0,2500]\n$x3$: [0,1500]\n$x4$: [0,1200]\nThe allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources. Given these conditions what would be minimum total cost in dollars that will satisfy all these conditions?
