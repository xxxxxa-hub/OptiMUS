A supply chain manager needs to decide the quantity of two products, $X$ and $Y$, to produce. Each unit of product $X$ has a production cost of $\$10$, while each unit of product $Y$ costs $\$15$. To meet customer demand, the company must manufacture at least twice as many units of product X plus three times as many units of product Y totaling at least 40 units. Due to capacity constraints, they cannot produce more than a combined total of 100 units from five times the number of units for product X plus four times the number of units for product Y. Both quantities need to be whole numbers due to the nature of manufacturing process. Given these conditions, what is the minimum total cost in dollars for producing products $X$ and $Y$, rounded to the nearest dollar?
