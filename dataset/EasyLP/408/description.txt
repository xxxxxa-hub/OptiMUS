A shipping company is planning to allocate resources to four different distribution centers: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These centers are responsible for distributing different types of goods. The cost associated with each unit of resource at the respective centers are \$100, \$200, \$150, and \$250.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary and capacity limitations:- The combined resource allocation for centers x1 and x2 cannot exceed 5000 units.- Similarly, the combined resource allocation for centers x3 and x4 cannot exceed 6000 units.- At least 3000 units of resources must be allocated between center x1 and center x3.- At least 4000 units of resources must be allocated between center x2 and center x4.\n\nEach center has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nCenter X1 can receive a minimum of 0 units up to a maximum of 5000 units,\nCenter X2 can receive a minimum of 0 units up to a maximum of 5000 units,\nCenter X3 can receive a minimum of 0 units up to a maximum of 6000 units,\nAnd Center X4 can also receive a minimum of 0 units up to a maximum of 6000 units.\n\nGiven that the allocations for all four distribution centers (x1,x2,x3,and x4) must be in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources involved in shipping operations:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for optimal distribution considering these constraints? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest dollar.
