A transportation company is planning to allocate its resources between two types of vehicles: X and Y, where the allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the vehicles. The total number of vehicles that can be supported is limited to 1000 due to maintenance constraints. Vehicle X requires a minimum allocation of 200 units to ensure operational efficiency, while vehicle Y has a minimum requirement of 300 units because it's crucial for certain routes. Each unit of vehicle X and Y incurs costs amounting to 50 and 70 support points respectively, and the company aims to minimize these total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints. In addition, both types have their own capacity limits with a maximum of 500 units for type X and a maximum of 700 units for type Y.\n\nGiven these conditions, calculate the minimum total support points required for this operation rounded off to the nearest whole number.
