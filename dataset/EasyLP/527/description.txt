A retail store manager needs to allocate resources among three departments: $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$. These departments could represent different sections of the store, such as clothing, electronics, and groceries. The total allocation across all three departments cannot exceed 200 units due to budget constraints. \n\nThe performance index, calculated as half of the allocation for department X1 minus 0.3 times the allocation for department X2 plus 0.4 times the allocation for department X3, must be at least 40 to ensure a satisfactory level of customer service and sales performance.\n\nMoreover, the difference between twice the resource allocated to department X2 and those allocated to both departments X1 and X3 combined should not exceed 70 units. This is meant to balance resources among these departments while emphasizing on department X2.\n\nEach unit of resource invested in departments $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$ incurs costs of 50 , 30 , and 20 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these operational constraints.\n\nGiven that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources being allocated (each unit represents an employee's full-time equivalent), what would be minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded up to nearest dollar.
