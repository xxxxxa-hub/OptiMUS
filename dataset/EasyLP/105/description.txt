A sports team is planning the allocation of weekly training hours for two different types of activities: $X$ represents strength conditioning and $Y$ represents skill development. The total combined hours of both activities cannot exceed 15 due to logistical constraints. Strength conditioning requires a minimum commitment of 5 hours per week to be effective, while skill development requires at least 3 hours per week. Each hour spent on strength conditioning contributes 20 units towards overall team fatigue, while each hour spent on skill development contributes 30 units.\n\nGiven that the objective is to minimize overall team fatigue while adhering to these time constraints (with allocations being in whole numbers due to scheduling practicalities), what is the minimum possible total fatigue score for the team, given an optimal allocation of training hours? Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.
