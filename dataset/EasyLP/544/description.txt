A project manager is working on a schedule for three tasks: $x1$, $x2$, and $x3$. These tasks could be part of a larger project or represent separate projects, and they are scheduled in whole hours due to the nature of the work. Each task has an associated productivity score per hour, with scores being 8, 5, and 6 for tasks $x1$, $x2$, and $x3$ respectively. The aim is to minimize the total productivity score while adhering to certain constraints related to task interactions and resource limitations.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n- The combined effort for twice the hours spent on task $x1$, four times that on task $x2$, and three times that on task $x3$ cannot exceed 40 units. This constraint might represent a limit on available resources such as manpower or equipment.\n- The sum of the hours spent on task $x1$ plus half those spent on task $x2$ minus one-fourth those spent on task $x3$ must be at least 10 units. This constraint could reflect requirements for balancing different types of work within the schedule.\n- The difference between two-and-a-half times the hours devoted to task $x2$ and those devoted to both tasks - namely, one time those for task$x1$ plus three-fourths time those for x3 - should not exceed -20 units. This could reflect specific needs regarding the balance among these tasks.\n\nFurthermore, each task has specific bounds due to other considerations such as deadline or capacity constraints: Task$x1$ must take no more than 30 hours; Task$x2$ can't exceed 20 hours; And Task$x3$ shouldn't go beyond 15 hours.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total productivity score given optimal scheduling of tasks within the specified bounds? Provide the answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
