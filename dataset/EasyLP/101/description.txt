A Human Resources manager is planning to hire new employees for two different positions: position X, with a salary of $\$5000$ per month, and position Y, with a salary of $\$8000$ per month. Due to budget constraints, the company can only afford to hire a total of $100$ new employees for these two positions. However, in order to meet the department's operational needs, at least $20$ employees must be hired for position X and at least $30$ employees must be hired for position Y. If all the number of hires has to be whole numbers (as you can't hire fractional parts of an employee), what is the minimum total monthly salary cost (in dollars) that the company would need to pay if they are hiring optimally? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
