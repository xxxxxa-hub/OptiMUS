A construction company is planning two major projects, Project X and Project Y. These projects require resources such as manpower, equipment, materials etc., which are quantified in units. The objective of the company is to minimize the total cost of these projects while adhering to several constraints. Each unit of resource allocated to Project X costs \$5000, while each unit for Project Y costs \$8000.\n\nThe company has the following constraints:\n\n- The combined resource allocation for both projects cannot exceed 100 units due to limited availability.\n- To maintain balance between different types of projects and ensure diversification, there must be at least 20 more units allocated to project X than project Y.\n- Furthermore, when considering a broader portfolio that includes other minor activities (not shown), the sum of units allocated to project X and twice those for project Y should not exceed 150 units.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of resource units due to practical reasons in construction industry (X,Y are integers), what is the minimum total cost for the company given an optimal allocation of resources between these two major projects? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
