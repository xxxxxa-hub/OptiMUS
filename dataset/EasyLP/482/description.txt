A school needs to allocate budget for two projects: Project $X$ is focused on improving the infrastructure and project $Y$ is aimed at enhancing the academic programs. The minimum budget required for project $X$ is $\$10$, and for project $Y$, it cannot be less than $\$5$. The total budget allocated for both projects combined cannot exceed $\$40$. Each unit of budget allocated to project $X$ and $Y$ yields different outcomes, quantified as 50 units and 30 units respectively. The school aims to maximize the total outcome while adhering to these constraints. Given that the budgets are integers due to accounting regulations, what would be the optimal outcome, rounded off to the nearest dollar?
