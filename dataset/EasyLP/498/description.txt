A real estate developer is planning to build residential and commercial buildings on a plot of land. The developer can construct a maximum of 15 residential buildings (denoted by $x$) and 10 commercial buildings (denoted by $y$), due to zoning regulations. The total number of buildings that can be built cannot exceed 20 because of the limited available land area.\n\nTo ensure a balanced development, the combined effort measured as twice the number of residential buildings plus half the number of commercial buildings must be at least 15. Additionally, to maintain an aesthetic balance in the development, the difference between the numbers of residential and commercial buildings should not exceed 5.\n\nThe construction cost for each residential building is \$30,000 and for each commercial building is \$50,000. All constructions are discrete projects and cannot be fractional. Given these conditions, what is the minimum possible total cost for constructing all the buildings while meeting all constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
