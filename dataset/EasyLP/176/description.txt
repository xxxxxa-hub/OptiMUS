An energy company is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total investment across all three projects has certain constraints due to budget limitations. Project $X$ and $Y$ combined cannot exceed 5000 units, while the combined investment for project $Y$ and $Z$ must be at least 3000 units. Furthermore, the sum of investments in project $X$ and project $Z$ should not exceed 4000 units.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects X, Y, and Z yields different returns or costs, quantified as 10 , 15 , and 20 units respectively. There are also bounds on each project's investment: Project X can take between 0 to 2000 units, Project Y can take between 0 to 1500 units and Project Z can take between 0 to 2500 units.\n\nThe company aims to minimize the total investment cost while adhering to these constraints. Also note that all investments need to be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources being allocated.\n\nCalculate the minimum total investment cost required for this scenario (in terms of unit cost), rounded off to the nearest whole number.
