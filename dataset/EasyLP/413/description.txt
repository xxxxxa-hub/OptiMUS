A marketing manager is planning the distribution of funds between two advertising campaigns, campaign $X1$ and campaign $X2$. The total budget for both campaigns combined cannot exceed $\$2000$. To meet the company's reach and frequency objectives, three times the budget for campaign $X1$, subtracting the budget for campaign $X2$, must be at least 500 units. Moreover, the difference between the budgets allocated to campaigns $X1$ and twice that of campaign $X2$ should not exceed 800 units.\n\nGiven that each unit of investment in campaigns $X1$ and $X2$ costs $\$1000$ and $\$500$, respectively, with a maximum allowable investment of $\$1500$ in campaign X1 and $\$1000$ in campaign X2. The marketing manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints, assuming that investments are made in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources being allocated. \n\nWhat would be the minimum possible cost (in dollars) given these conditions? Please round your answer to nearest dollar.
