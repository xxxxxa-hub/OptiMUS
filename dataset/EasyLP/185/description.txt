A manufacturing company is planning the production of three products: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The objective is to minimize the total production cost associated with these products, with costs being $\$50$ per unit for product X, $\$30$ per unit for product Y, and $\$20$ per unit for product Z. The allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget, manpower, and raw material limitations:- The combined production quantity of products X, Y, and Z cannot exceed 500 units.- To meet market demand and balance the production line load, the combined output of three times product X minus product Y plus product Z must be at least 100 units.- Also considering other factors such as storage space and supply chain logistics, the quantity of product X minus twice that of product Y minus that of product Z should not exceed 200 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the requirement that all production quantities are integers (as it's impossible to produce fractional units), what is the minimum total production cost for this scenario in dollars rounded to nearest whole number?
