A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: x1, x2, and x3. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, and implementing new technologies, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 5, 3, and 7 units for x1, x2, and x3 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and project requirements:- The combined resource allocation for twice the allocation for x1 plus x2 must be at least 10 units.- The allocation for x1 plus three times the allocation for x3 cannot exceed 20 units.- The allocation for x2 minus four times the allocation for x3 must be at least 5 units.\n\nGiven that each project has specific bounds on resource allocation (0-15 units for project X1; 0-10 units for project X2; and 0-8 units for project X3) and taking into account that all allocations are integers due to indivisible nature of resources:\nWhat is the minimum total cost possible given these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number in unit cost.
