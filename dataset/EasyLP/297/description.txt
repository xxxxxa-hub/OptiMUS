A school is planning to allocate resources including teachers, classrooms and textbooks for the upcoming academic year. The total cost per unit of resource is as follows: each teacher costs 2 units, each classroom costs 3 units and each textbook costs 4 units. There are certain requirements that need to be met:\n\n- The combined requirement of one teacher, two classrooms and three textbooks must be at least 50.\n- The combined requirement of two teachers and one classroom cannot exceed 30.\n- The difference between the number of teachers and classrooms plus the number of textbooks must be at least 10.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that the numbers of teachers, classrooms, and textbooks should all be integers due to practical limitations. What is the minimum total cost in units for meeting these requirements?
