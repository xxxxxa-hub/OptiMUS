A healthcare organization is planning to allocate resources between three different programs: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could be related to different health initiatives like disease prevention, health education, or hospital infrastructure development. The total available resource units for all three programs combined cannot exceed 100 due to budget constraints. Additionally, each program has its minimum requirement for being effective: Program $X$ requires at least 10 units, Program $Y$ requires at least 20 units and Program $Z$ needs a minimum of 15 units. Each unit of resource allocated to the programs costs differently based on the nature of the program: For Program $X$, it's $\$30$, for Program $Y$, it's $\$20$ and for Program $Z$, it's $\$50$. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting these requirements (all allocations are integers). What is the minimal possible cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
