A marketing manager is planning to allocate a budget across three different marketing channels, X, Y, and Z. The total investment in channel X and channel Y should not exceed $1000, while the combined investment for channels Y and Z should not be more than $800. Moreover, the combined investment for channels X and Z must be at least $500. Each dollar invested in these channels yields different returns on investment (ROI) - 2 units of ROI for every dollar spent on channel X, 3 units of ROI per dollar on channel Y, and 5 units of ROI per dollar on channel Z. If the objective is to minimize the total cost while ensuring all investments are in whole numbers due to budgeting constraints: What is the minimum total cost needed to meet all these conditions? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
