A construction company is planning to allocate resources across four different projects: Project X1, X2, X3, and X4. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$100, \$200, \$150, and \$50 per unit for project X1, X2, X3 and X4 respectively.\n\nThe resource allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and project requirements:\n\n- The combined resource allocation for project X1 and project X2 cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- Twice the resources allocated for project X1 combined with those allocated for project X3 should be at least 800 units.\n- Resources allocated for Project X4 should not be less than half of that allocated to Project X1.\n- The difference in resources between a quarter of those assigned to Project x3 and all those assigned to Project x2 should not exceed 500 units.\n- A certain balance between projects must be maintained such that subtracting the allocation for Projects x1 and x3 from the sum of allocations for Projects x2 and x4 results in exactly 70 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with specific upper limits on each project's resource allocation (X1: 500 units; X2: 300 units; x3: 200 units; x4:400units), what is the minimum total cost for this construction company? Assume that all allocations are in whole numbers due to practicality.
