A transportation company is planning to allocate its fleet of vehicles across three routes: $X, Y$, and $Z$. Each route requires a different type of vehicle with varying operating costs. The operating cost per vehicle for routes $X, Y$, and $Z$ are 10, 15, and 20 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total operating cost while adhering to the following constraints:\n\n- Due to traffic restrictions and road capacity, the combined number of vehicles on routes X and Y cannot exceed 1000.\n- Similarly, the combined number of vehicles on routes Y and Z cannot exceed 800 due to similar limitations.\n- To maintain service levels across all regions served by these routes, the sum of vehicles on routes X and Z must be at least 500.\n\nThe allocation must also respect individual route capacity limits due to physical or regulatory restrictions: route X can accommodate up to 700 vehicles; route Y can have a maximum of 600 vehicles; while route Z can only handle up to 400 vehicles. Given that each route's allocation must be in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of a vehicle,\n\nWhat is the minimum total operating cost for this scenario when optimal allocations are made for each route? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
