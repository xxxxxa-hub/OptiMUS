A real estate investor is planning to purchase properties in two different locations, $X$ and $Y$. Each property at location $X$ costs \$200,000 and each property at location $Y$ costs \$300,000. Due to budget constraints, the total number of properties that can be purchased cannot exceed 10. To diversify the risk and ensure a balanced portfolio, the number of properties purchased at location X should be at least three times the number of properties purchased at location Y. Also due to certain legal requirements, the investor has to buy at least one property in both locations.\n\nIf we assume that all purchases are for whole numbers of properties (since fractional property purchases are not possible), what is the minimum total cost for this investment strategy? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
