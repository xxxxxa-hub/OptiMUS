A marketing manager is planning the distribution of budget across four different advertising channels: $X, Y, Z$, and $W$. These could represent investments in online ads, TV commercials, print media, and event sponsorships respectively. The total budget for channels $X$ and $Y$ combined is constrained to a maximum of $\$ 100$, while the combined budget for channels $Z$ and $W$ cannot exceed $\$ 200$. Furthermore, to achieve the desired outreach objectives, the sum of budgets for channel $X$ and channel $Z$ must be at least $\$ 50$, while that of channel $Y$ and channel $W$ must be at least $\$ 70$. The costs per unit effectiveness are given as follows: For channel X it's $\$10$, for Y it's $\$15$, for Z it's $\$25$, and W has a cost of \$30. All budget allocations should be integers due to billing policies.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars to achieve all these conditions (rounded to nearest dollar)?
