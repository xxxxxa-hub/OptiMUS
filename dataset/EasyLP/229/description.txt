A telecommunications company is planning to distribute its resources across three key areas: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These areas might represent expanding the network, upgrading technology, and improving customer service respectively. The total resource allocated across all three areas cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Each area has a minimum requirement for it to be effective: area $X$ requires at least 200 units, area $Y$ requires at least 150 units, and area $Z$ requires at least 250 units. The cost associated with each unit of resource in areas $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are \$10, \$15, and \$20 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints (note that X,Y,Z are integers). What is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
