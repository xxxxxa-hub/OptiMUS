A supply chain manager needs to optimize the distribution of goods between two warehouses: $X$ and $Y$. The total number of goods that need to be distributed is at least 1000. Additionally, due to transportation capacity constraints, the combined amount of goods distributed to warehouse X (doubled) and warehouse Y cannot exceed 2500.\n\nEach unit of good transported to warehouse $X$ costs \$5, and each unit transported to warehouse $Y$ costs \$3. The aim is to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting all these constraints. Given that the units of goods are whole numbers due to their indivisible nature, what is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this operation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
