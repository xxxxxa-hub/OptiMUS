In an energy management scenario, a company is planning to allocate resources between two projects: $X$ and $Y$. These projects could involve the implementation of new energy-saving technologies or the upgrade of existing infrastructure. The total resource allocation across both projects cannot exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum investment of 1000 units for it to be viable, while project $Y$ requires at least 1500 units because of its larger scale. The cost associated with each unit invested in project $X$ and project $Y$ is \$100 and \$75 respectively.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of allocated resources due to the indivisible nature of the resources, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
