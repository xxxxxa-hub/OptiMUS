In an energy management scenario, a country is planning to generate power from four different sources: coal, gas, nuclear and solar. The costs associated with generating each unit of power are $10 for coal, $15 for gas, $20 for nuclear and $25 for solar.\n\nThe generation must meet the following constraints due to environmental regulations, technological limitations and strategic objectives:\n- The combined units of power generated from coal and gas should be at least 400 units to ensure base load capacity.\n- The difference in units between nuclear and solar cannot exceed 100 units as part of a policy to balance non-renewable and renewable sources.\n- Coal-based generation must exceed nuclear-based generation by at least 200 units due to availability of resources.\n- Combined generation from gas and solar should be at least 500 units as these are cleaner energy sources.\n\nGiven that the number of power generation units have to be integers due to the indivisible nature of the technology used,\nThe question is: What is the minimum total cost in dollars for the country given this optimal allocation strategy? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
