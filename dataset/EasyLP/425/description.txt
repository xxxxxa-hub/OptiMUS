A manufacturing company produces two products, X and Y. The total production of both products cannot exceed 300 units due to factory capacity constraints. In order to meet market demand, the combined output of 3 units of product X and 4 units of product Y must be at least 800. Additionally, the company wants to maintain or increase the quantity of product X compared to product Y in its production plan.\n\nThe manufacturing costs per unit are $\$50$ for product X and $\$70$ for product Y. Both quantities must be integers because the products can't be produced partially.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost that allows the company to satisfy all these conditions? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
