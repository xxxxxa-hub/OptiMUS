A retail store manager is planning the allocation of monthly budget across four categories: Stock (inventory purchase), Rent, Wages (employee salaries), and Utilities. Each category has a different cost per unit, being 5 units for Stock, 4 units for Rent, 3 units for Wages, and 2 units for Utilities. The following constraints must be adhered to due to operational and financial requirements:\n\n- The difference between the allocation for Stock and Rent should be at least 1000 units.\n- The combined allocation for Wages and Utilities cannot exceed 5000 units.\n- The difference between the allocation for Stock and Wages should be at least 1500 units.\n- The sum of allocations for Rent and Utilities must exactly equal to 2000 units.\n\nIn addition to these constraints, each category has a minimum budget requirement that must be met: \n\n- Stock requires at least 1000 units,\n- Rent requires at least 500 units,\n- Wages require at least 1200 units,\n- Utilities require at least 300 units. \nThe manager aims to minimize the total monthly expenditure while meeting all the above constraints. Given that all allocations are made in whole numbers due to accounting requirements, calculate the minimum possible total monthly expenditure in unit currency rounded to the nearest whole number.
