A farmer is planning to plant two types of crops, $X$ and $Y$, in his field. He can plant at most 50 acres of land due to limited resources. To meet the market demand, he must plant at least twice as much crop $X$ as crop $Y$, but the total area planted with crops $X$ and $Y$ should be at least 40 acres. Furthermore, the acreage of crop X cannot exceed twice that of crop Y by more than 10 acres.\n\nThe cost per acre for planting crop X is $\$5$, while for crop Y it's $\$10$. Both areas need to be integers because they represent whole numbers of acres.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount the farmer needs to spend on planting these crops while meeting all constraints? The answer should be given in dollars and rounded to the nearest dollar.
