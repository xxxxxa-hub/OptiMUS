A transportation company has two types of trucks, $X$ and $Y$. The company needs to dispatch these trucks to deliver a large shipment. Due to the cargo's size, at least 300 type $X$ trucks and at least 200 type $Y$ trucks must be dispatched. However, due to the limitations of staff and equipment, the total number of both types of trucks cannot exceed 1000. Each type $X$ truck costs $\$2$, and each type $Y$ truck costs $\$3$. The aim is to minimize the total cost while meeting all delivery requirements (considering X,Y are integers). What is the minimum total cost in dollars that the company can achieve for this delivery, rounded to the nearest dollar?
