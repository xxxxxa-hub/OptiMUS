A construction company is planning the allocation of resources between two types of projects, $X$ and $Y$. The total number of projects that can be supported is limited to 15 due to logistical constraints. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined strength of 2 units of project X and 3 units of project Y must be at least 10. Each unit of project X and Y requires 5 and 3 support points respectively, and the company aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total support points required for this operation if both $X$ and $Y$ are integers, rounded to the nearest whole number.
