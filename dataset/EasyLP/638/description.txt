A school is planning its budget for the upcoming academic year. The main expense categories are teacher salaries, classroom rent, textbook costs, and miscellaneous expenses. The budget needs to be allocated among these categories in a way that minimizes the total expenditure while meeting certain constraints.\n\nEach category has a cost associated with it which represents how much of the school's resources are consumed per unit: 0.3 units for teacher salaries, 0.2 units for classroom rent, 0.4 units for textbook costs, and 0.1 units for miscellaneous expenses.\n\nThe following conditions must be met:\n- Teacher salaries should not be less than $50,000 and cannot exceed $80,000 due to contractual obligations and the school's salary policy.\n- Classroom rent must not exceed $20,000 but also should not be less than $10,000 due to current market rates and location-specific considerations.\n- Textbook costs cannot go beyond $10,000 but also need to be at least $5,000 considering the educational standards maintained by the school.\n- Miscellaneous expenses should amount to at least $5,000 but no more than $7,000 as per prior trends and future projections.\n\nAdditionally:\n-The total allocation across all four categories must equal the set budget available for the academic year (i.e., Teacher Salary + Classroom Rent + Textbook Costs + Miscellaneous Expenses = Budget).\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers in dollars due to accounting practices (thus making this an integer linear programming problem), what would be the minimum total cost (in resource consumption units) required by this budget allocation plan? Provide your answer rounded off to two decimal places.
