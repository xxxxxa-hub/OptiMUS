A construction company is planning to allocate resources among four different projects: $X1, X2, X3,$ and $X4$. These projects could involve building roads, bridges, buildings, or infrastructure respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$500 for $X1$, \$400 for $X2$, \$300 for $X3$ and \$200 for $X4$ per unit of resource.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and project requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for $X1$ and $X2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The combined effort of twice the resources allocated to $X2$ and those allocated to $X3$ should be at least 800 units.\n- Resources assigned to project $X1$ can't exceed half of those assigned to project $X3$, ensuring a balanced distribution of workloads.\n- Project $X4$ requires at least 200 fewer resources than what's allocated for project $X1$\n- Project 4 also needs at least 150 fewer resources than what's designated for project 2\n\nMoreover, each project has specific bounds on resource allocation. \n\nGiven all these conditions along with the requirement that the allocations must be in whole numbers due to logistical reasons:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars (rounded up), given an optimal allocation of resources across all four projects?
