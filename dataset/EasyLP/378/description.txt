In a human resources scenario, a company needs to allocate staff across four different projects: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These could represent various strategic initiatives or functional areas within the organization. The total number of employees that can be allocated to projects $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 40 due to space constraints in the office buildings where these projects are based. Similarly, the total number of employees that can be allocated to projects $x3$ and $x4$ is capped at 60 because of similar reasons.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure that there is sufficient manpower for each type of project, the company has stipulated that the sum of employees on project $x1$ and project $x3$ must be at least 20. Similarly, the combined number of employees on project $x2$ and project $x4$ must be at least 30.\n\nThe cost associated with each employee varies depending on their role in each project, quantified as \$50 for an employee on project $x1$, \$80 for an employee on project $x2$, \$30 for an employee on project x3$, and \$70 for an employee on project x4$. The company aims to minimize this cost while adhering to all the above-mentioned constraints. Moreover, since we cannot have fractional allocation of employees (as they represent whole individuals), values for x1, x2, x3, and x4 should all be integers.\n\nWithin these conditions and considering specific bounds for each variable ($0 \leq x1 \leq 25,\;0 \leq x2 \leq 25,\;0 \leq x3 \leq 35,\;0 \leq x4 \leq 35)$:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for the company in dollars, rounded to the nearest whole dollar?
