A retail store manager needs to decide on the inventory levels for two product categories: X and Y. The objective is to minimize the total cost of carrying these inventories, given that each unit of category X costs \$20 and each unit of category Y costs \$30. The combined inventory level for both categories cannot exceed 500 units due to storage limitations.\n\nIn order to satisfy customer demand and maintain a diverse product offering, the combined effect calculated as three times the units of category X plus twice the units of category Y must be at least 1000. Additionally, four times the units from category X should not exceed by more than 600 from those of category Y.\n\nConsidering that inventory levels need to be whole numbers due to their physical nature, and also there are specific bounds on how many units can be carried for each product (400 for X and 300 for Y), what is the minimum total cost in dollars required? Please round your answer to nearest dollar.
