A retail store manager is planning to allocate resources between three departments: $X1, X2$, and $X3$. These could represent different product categories such as electronics, clothing, and groceries. The total resource allocation across all three departments cannot exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints. To achieve a balanced inventory profile, the combined effort of these departments must yield a minimum effectiveness score calculated as half of the allocation for department $X1$, 40% for department $X2$ and 60% for department $X3$ that should be at least 2000 points. Also, the difference in resource allocation between twice of department $X2$ and the sum of departments $X1$ and $X3$ cannot exceed 100 units. This ensures an optimal balance between various product categories.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to departments $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$ incurs costs of 50, 75 ,and 60 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints ensuring that allocations are whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources being allocated.\n\nEach department has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nDepartment X1 can have anywhere from 0 up to a maximum of 3000 units,\nDepartment X2 can have anywhere from 0 up to a maximum of 2500 units,\nDepartment X3 can have anywhere from 0 up to a maximum of 1500 units.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded off to the nearest dollar.
