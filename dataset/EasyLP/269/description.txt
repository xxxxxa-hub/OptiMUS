A human resources manager is planning the hiring strategy for a company. The company needs to hire three types of employees: $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. Due to budget constraints, the total number of hires across all three categories cannot exceed 100 people. The minimum number of hires required for each category are as follows: 20 for category $X$, 30 for category $Y$ and 10 for category $Z$. The salaries per employee are $\$50000$ for category X, $\$70000$ for category Y and $\$90000$ for category Z. Given that all hired employees must be whole numbers due to practical considerations, what is the minimum total salary cost in dollars if the company hires optimally while adhering to these constraints? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
