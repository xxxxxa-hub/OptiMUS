A manufacturing company is planning to allocate its production resources across four different product lines: x1, x2, x3, and x4. The company's objective is to minimize the total production cost associated with these products. The unit costs for producing items in product lines x1, x2, x3, and x4 are \$50, \$60, \$70 and \$80 respectively.\n\nThe allocation of resources must satisfy the following conditions due to supply constraints and market demand:\n- The combined output from product lines x1 and x2 should not exceed 1000 units.\n- The sum of twice the output from line x3 and thrice that from line x4 should not surpass 1200 units.\n- To meet minimum order requirements and maintain a diverse portfolio, the overall production across all four lines must be at least 500 units.\n- Additionally, in order to balance the product mix and ensure stability in operations, it is necessary that the quantity produced in line x1 exceeds half of that produced in line x3.\n\nConsidering each line has specific bounds on production capacity between 0 to their respective maximum limits (600 for X1, 400 for X2, 500 for X3 and 300 for X4),\nwhat would be the minimum total cost needed for optimal resource allocation across these four product lines? Note that as production outputs are quantified in whole numbers due to industrial realities such as batch sizes or equipment capabilities. Provide your answer rounded off to nearest dollar.
