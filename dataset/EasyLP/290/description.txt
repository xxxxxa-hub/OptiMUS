An educational institution is planning to distribute resources among three departments: X, Y, and Z. These could represent the Sciences, Arts, and Sports departments respectively. The total number of resources distributed must be at least 50 due to institutional requirements. However, there are additional constraints that must be adhered to:\n\n- Four times the resources allocated to department X minus those for department Y cannot exceed 30.\n- The resources allocated to department Z minus twice those for department Y must be at least 10.\n\nThe costs associated with allocating each resource unit are as follows: $5$ for department X, $3$ for department Y, and $2$ for department Z. Given that the institution aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that allocations are in whole numbers (since fractional resources cannot be assigned), what is the minimum total cost in dollars?
