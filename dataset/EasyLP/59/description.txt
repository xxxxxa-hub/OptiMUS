A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources between two key areas: $X$ (Network Upgrade) and $Y$ (Security Enhancement). The allocation of resources must meet certain conditions. To ensure a minimum level of network performance, the combined effect calculated as three times the resources allocated for Network Upgrade plus the resources allocated for Security Enhancement should be at least 10 units. On the other hand, to avoid overstretching their capacity, twice the resources allocated for Network Upgrade and four times that for Security Enhancement should not exceed 20 units. Each unit of resource allocated to Network Upgrade and Security Enhancement has a cost associated with it - 4 and 6 units respectively. The aim is to minimize this total cost while meeting all constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers due to practicalities in resource allocation, what would be the minimum total cost? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
