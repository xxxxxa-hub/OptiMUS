An environmental agency is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different environmental conservation initiatives such as forest preservation, ocean cleanup, and air pollution control. The total investment across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Moreover, the resource allocation for project X must be at least twice that of project Y plus 200 units to cater to its higher resource requirements. Project Z requires a minimum of 100 more units than project Y, possibly due to its larger scale or higher initial setup costs.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as 10 , 15 , and 20 units respectively. The agency aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are integers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
