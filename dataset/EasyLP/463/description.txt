A supply chain manager is planning the allocation of resources between two warehouses, $X$ and $Y$, to optimize inventory levels. The total amount of resources allocated to both warehouses combined should not exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints. Warehouse $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 1000 units for efficient operations, while warehouse $Y$ has a maximum capacity of 3000 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to warehouse $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of $\$50$ and $\$75$, respectively. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers in terms of resource allocation due to the indivisible nature of resources, what is the minimum total cost required for optimal resource allocation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
