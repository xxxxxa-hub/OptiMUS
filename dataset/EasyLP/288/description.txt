A school is planning to optimize its budget allocation for teachers, students, and classrooms. The cost per teacher is \$5000, the cost per student is \$3000, and the cost for each classroom is \$10000. The school has a few constraints: - For every 30 teachers hired, there can be no more than 600 students enrolled due to the student-to-teacher ratio standards.- There should be at least one classroom for every 40 students to accommodate them all comfortably.Furthermore, the school must hire at least 10 teachers and enroll at least 200 students. Also, a minimum of 5 classrooms needs to be maintained in order to function properly.Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers in hiring teachers and enrolling students due to practicalities as well as having an integral number of classrooms:What would be the minimum total cost for this education scenario in dollars when optimally allocating resources among teachers, students, and classrooms? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest dollar.
