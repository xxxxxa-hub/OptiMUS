A transportation company is planning to allocate its fleet of vehicles across three different routes: X, Y, and Z. The total number of vehicles available for these routes cannot exceed 1000 due to resource limitations. To meet the minimum demand, route X requires at least 300 vehicles, route Y requires at least 200 vehicles, and route Z requires at least 150 vehicles. Each vehicle allocated to routes X, Y, and Z incurs costs of $3, $2, and $5 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. What is the minimum total cost required for this allocation plan? Please give your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
