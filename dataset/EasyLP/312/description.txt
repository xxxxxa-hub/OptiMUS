A military general is planning the allocation of resources between three divisions: infantry (division X), artillery (division Y), and air support (division Z). The total resource allocation across all three divisions cannot exceed 1000 units due to logistical constraints. Division X requires at least 200 units more than twice the allocation for division Y, reflecting specific strategic objectives. Additionally, the combined resource allocation for divisions Y and Z cannot exceed 800 units, ensuring a balanced force structure.\n\nEach unit of resources allocated to divisions X, Y, and Z incurs costs of 500 , 700 , and 300 respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints, with each division receiving whole number allocations due to the nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost for this operation in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
