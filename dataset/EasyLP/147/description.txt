A military logistics operation needs to distribute resources between two units, X and Y. Each unit of X and Y requires 50 and 75 support points respectively. The combined strength of twice the amount of unit X and one unit Y must be at least 60 for a successful mission, while the sum of one unit of X and three times the amount of unit Y cannot exceed 120 due to logistical constraints. The commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated, given that both the number of units for X and Y are integers due to their indivisible nature. What is the minimum total support points required for this operation, rounded to the nearest whole number?
