A manufacturing company is planning to produce three types of products: x1, x2, and x3. The production cost for each type are 2, 3, and 4 units respectively. The company has several constraints due to capacity limitations:\n\n- The combined production of product x1 and twice the production of product x2 cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The production for three times product x1 must be at least greater by 300 units than that for product x3.\n- The combined production of four times product x2 and product x3 cannot exceed 1500 units.\n- The difference between five times the quantity produced of product X2 and the sum of quantities produced for products X1 and X3 must not surpass 70 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the requirement that the number of units produced for each type (x1, x2, and x3) must be integers because you can't produce a fraction of a unit. Additionally, each type has specific bounds on its production due to various factors such as demand or resource availability:\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost in terms of unit cost for producing these products within their specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
