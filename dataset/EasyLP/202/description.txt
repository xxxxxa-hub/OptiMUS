A financial manager is planning the allocation of funds across three different projects: X, Y, and Z. The total available budget for all three projects combined cannot exceed \$5000 due to fiscal constraints. The manager also needs to ensure that the allocation for project X exceeds twice the allocation for project Y by at least \$1000, possibly due to greater potential returns or higher strategic importance associated with project X. Additionally, the allocation for project Z must exceed that of project Y by at least \$1500, reflecting differing risk profiles or expected ROI between these two projects.\n\nEach dollar allocated to projects X, Y, and Z incurs costs of \$10 , \$15 , and \$20 respectively - these could represent management fees, operational costs or other expenses related to each project.\n\nGiven that all allocations must be in whole dollars due to the indivisible nature of monetary units (X,Y,Z are integers), what is the minimum total cost incurred by allocating funds optimally among these three projects? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
