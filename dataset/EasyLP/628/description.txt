A human resources manager is planning to allocate employees across four different departments: x1, x2, x3, and x4. The objective is to minimize the total salary cost associated with these departments. Each employee in departments x1, x2, x3 and x4 earns a salary of \$5000, \$4000, \$6000 and \$7000 per month respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to various departmental needs:\n- The combined number of employees in departments x1 and x2 cannot exceed 100 due to space limitations.\n- Similarly, the combined number of employees in departments x3 and x4 cannot exceed 80 due to resource constraints.\n- The number of employees in department X1 must be at least 20 more than half the number of employees in department X3 to ensure proper supervision.\n- The difference between the number of employees in department X4 and X2 should not exceed 30 for balance within the organization.\n\nAdditionally, each department has specific bounds on its staff size: \nx1 can have up to 50 employees,\nx2 can have up to 60,\nx3 can have up to 40,\nx4 can also have up to 40.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the requirement that the employee count for each department must be whole numbers due to practicality:\nWhat is the minimum total monthly salary expense for this company given optimal staffing decisions across all four departments? Provide your answer rounded down to nearest dollar.
