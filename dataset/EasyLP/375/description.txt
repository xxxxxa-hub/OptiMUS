A Human Resources manager is planning the allocation of newly hired employees across four different departments: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These departments could be Marketing, Sales, Finance and IT respectively. The objective is to minimize the total hiring cost associated with these departments, with costs being 50, 70, 90 and 110 units for each employee in x1, x2, x3 and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and space constraints:- The combined number of employees in department x1 and department x2 cannot exceed 40.- Similarly, the combined number of employees in department x2 and department x3 cannot exceed 30.- Also,the combined number of employees in department x3 and department x4 cannot exceed 20.- The number of employees in department X1 must be at least half the size of the team in X4 plus an additional ten members.\n\nGiven these constraints along with specific bounds on employee allocation for each department (20 for X1,15 for X2 ,10 for X3 ,5 for X4) what is the minimum total cost (in unit terms)for hiring new employees given that all allocations should be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of manpower?
