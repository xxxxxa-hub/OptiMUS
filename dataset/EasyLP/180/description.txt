An energy company needs to distribute resources among three projects: Project $X$, Project $Y$, and Project $Z$. These could represent investments in different forms of renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. The total resources available for all three projects combined cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Additionally, the sum of twice the resources allocated to Project $X$ and the resources for Project $Y$ must be at least 500 units to ensure a balanced portfolio. Moreover, the sum of the resources allocated to Project $X$ and twice that of Project $Z$ cannot exceed 600 units because of technical or logistical limitations.\n\nEach unit of resource invested in Projects X, Y, and Z yields costs quantified as 6 , 3 , and 5 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are integers due to the indivisible nature of resources.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
