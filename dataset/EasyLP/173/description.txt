A marketing manager is planning the distribution of a budget between three advertising channels for an upcoming campaign: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total budget for all channels combined cannot exceed $\$5000$. To meet the campaign's reach and frequency objectives, the combined effort of these channels must yield certain minimum effectiveness scores calculated based on the following equations:\n\n- 3 times the budget for channel X minus the budget for channel Y plus the budget for channel Z must be at least $\$2000$.\n- The budget for channel X subtracted from twice the budget for channel Y and reduced by the budget for channel Z should not exceed $\$1000$.\n- The budget allocated to channel X less that of Channel Y added with thrice that of Channel Z should be at least $\$1500$\n\nThe cost per unit of effectiveness varies by each advertising medium: it is $\$60$ per unit for $X$, $\$75$ per unit for $Y$, and $\$50$ per unit for $Z$. Given these conditions and aiming to minimize total cost while ensuring that all budgets are in whole numbers due to accounting regulations. What is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to nearest dollar, which meets all requirements?
