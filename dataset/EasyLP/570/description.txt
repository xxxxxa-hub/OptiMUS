In a military operation, a commander needs to distribute resources between three types of units: X, Y, and Z. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the units. The total number of units that can be supported is limited to 1000 due to logistical constraints. In addition, twice the allocation for unit X combined with the allocation for unit Y must meet or exceed 200 units. Furthermore, the difference between the allocations for unit X and unit Z cannot exceed 50 units. Also, the sum of allocations for units Y and Z should not fall below 400 units. Each unit type has different support requirements: each unit of type X requires 500 support points, each unit of type Y requires 300 support points, and each unit of type Z requires 700 support points. The commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints.\n\nCalculate the minimum total support points required for this operation given these conditions and rounding to nearest whole number.
