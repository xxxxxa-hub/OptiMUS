A tourism agency is planning to allocate resources across four different tours: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These could represent various types of tours like historical tours, cultural tours, adventure trips or culinary experiences. The cost associated with each type of tour are 100, 200, 300 and 400 units respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting certain requirements.\n\nThe agency must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and demand considerations:- The combined allocation for tours x1 and x2 cannot exceed 500 units.- The combined allocation for tours x3 and x4 cannot exceed 600 units.- To ensure a diverse offering, the combined allocation for tours x1 and x3 should be at least 300 units.- Similarly, the combined allocation for tours x2 and x4 should be at least 400 units.\n\nAdditionally, there are specific bounds on resource allocations due to logistical constraints or regulatory compliance:- Tour allocations must be whole numbers as it's not possible to offer a fraction of a tour.- Each tour has an upper limit on resource allocation: Tours X1 and X2 can have up to a maximum of 500 units allocated each while Tours X3 and X4 can have up to a maximum of 600 units each.\n\nGiven these conditions:What is the minimum total cost for the agency given an optimal allocation of resources among the four types of tours? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
