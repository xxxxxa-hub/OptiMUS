A travel agency is planning to distribute its budget among three popular tourist destinations: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different countries, cities, or types of vacation packages. The total investment across all three destinations cannot exceed 500 units due to the company's budget constraints. \n\nTo attract a diverse group of travelers, the combined investment in destination $X$ (doubled) and destination $Y$ (tripled) should be at least 400 units. Furthermore, the difference between the investments in destination $Y$ and destination $Z$ must not exceed 150 units to ensure balance in promoting these two destinations. Lastly, the agency wants to ensure that destination $X$ gets enough promotion so the difference between the investments in destination $X$ and destination $Z$ should be at least 100 units.\n\nEach unit of investment in destinations $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs of 50 , 30 , and 80 units respectively. The company aims to minimize this cost while meeting all other requirements.\n\nGiven these conditions and taking into account that investments need to be whole numbers due to accounting rules, what is the minimum total cost for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
