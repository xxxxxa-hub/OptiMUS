A manufacturing company is planning to allocate resources across four different production lines: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These lines could represent different products or services that the company offers. The total allocation for production lines $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 5000 units due to capacity constraints, while the total allocation for lines $x3$ and $x4$ is limited to 2000 units. In addition, the combined output of twice as much from line $x1$ and four times from line $x2$ must not be less than the output from line $x3$. Moreover, the combined output of line $x2$ and three times from line x4 minus that of line x1 should be at least 100 units.\n\nEach unit produced in production lines costs differently: 50 units for line $x1$, 60 units for line x2, 30 units for line x3, and 20 units for line x4. The company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints. Also note that because each unit represents a complete product or service offering, it is not possible to produce fractional units (i.e., all allocations must be whole numbers).\n\nGiven these conditions, find the minimum total cost required rounded to nearest whole number.
