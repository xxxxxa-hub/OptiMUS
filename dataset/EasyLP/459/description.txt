A scheduling manager needs to allocate hours between two tasks, X and Y. The total hours allocated must be whole numbers due to the nature of these tasks. The combined effort for these tasks should be at least 50 hours. However, the sum of twice the hours allocated to task X and those for task Y cannot exceed 120 hours. Additionally, the allocation for task X should not be less than that for task Y.\n\nEach hour dedicated to tasks X and Y incurs a cost of 8 and 10 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scheduling plan, rounded to the nearest whole number.
