In a healthcare setting, a hospital administrator is planning to allocate resources among three departments: X1 for surgery, X2 for internal medicine, and X3 for diagnostics. The allocations must be in whole numbers due to the nature of the resources being allocated. The total resource allocation across all three departments cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. Additionally, twice the allocation for surgery (X1) must exceed half of that for internal medicine (X2) by at least 30 units to ensure a high standard of surgical care. Moreover, half of the resources allocated to diagnostics (X3), when subtracted from those allocated to surgery (X1), should not exceed 20 units in order to maintain balanced service provision.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource varies between departments: it is $0.5 per unit for surgery (X1), $0.3 per unit for internal medicine (X2), and $0.7 per unit for diagnostics (X3). Given these constraints and costs, and considering that each department has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost required given an optimal allocation of resources across these three departments? Provide your answer in dollars rounded off to one decimal place.
