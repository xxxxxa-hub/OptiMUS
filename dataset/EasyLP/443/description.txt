A retail store manager is planning to stock two types of products, X and Y. The total quantity of these two products should not exceed 1000 due to storage limitations. In order to maintain a balanced inventory, the quantity of product X minus twice the quantity of product Y should be at least 300. Furthermore, three times the quantity of product X along with that of product Y must be at least 500 to meet customer demand.\n\nThe costs associated with each unit of product X and Y are 5 and 2 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the quantities for both X and Y are integers due to packaging constraints.\n\nGiven that there are specific bounds on the quantities for both products (X can range from 0-600 units, while Y can range from 0-500 units), what is the minimum total cost for stocking these products under optimal conditions? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
