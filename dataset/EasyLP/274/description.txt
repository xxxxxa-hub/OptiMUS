A sports team is planning their training schedule for the upcoming season. The team consists of three groups, each focusing on a different aspect: Group $X$ focuses on endurance, Group $Y$ on skill development, and Group $Z$ on strategy. The coach wants to minimize the overall fatigue score while ensuring that the training is effective.\n\nEach hour of training contributes to the fatigue score differently: It's 10 for group $X$, 15 for group $Y$, and 20 for group $Z$. The total hours spent in training by all groups should not exceed 100 hours per week due to physical limitations and recovery needs.\n\nTo ensure a balanced program, the following conditions must be met:\n- The difference between the hours spent by group X and group Y should be at least 20 hours. This ensures that endurance (Group X) is given more focus than skill development (Group Y).\n- The difference between the hours spent by Group Z and Group X should not exceed 30 hours. This ensures that strategic thinking (Group Z) does not lag too far behind endurance training (Group X).\n\nThe allocation of time for each group has certain bounds due to specific constraints:\n- Group X can train from zero up to a maximum of 60 hours per week.\n- For Group Y, it's from zero up to a maximum of 50 hours per week.\n- And for Group Z, it's from zero up to a maximum of 70 hours per week.\n\nGiven these constraints, how can they minimize the total fatigue score while adhering to these conditions? Remember that training schedules need to be in whole numbers as partial-hour schedules are impractical. What is this minimum total fatigue score? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
