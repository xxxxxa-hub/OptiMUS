A supply chain manager is planning the distribution of goods between two warehouses, $X$ and $Y$. The total quantity of goods distributed to both warehouses cannot exceed 1000 units due to capacity constraints. In addition, the combined quantity for twice the amount at warehouse X and the amount at warehouse Y must be at least 800 units to meet demand requirements. Moreover, the difference in quantities between warehouse X and twice that of warehouse Y should not exceed 200 units to maintain a balanced inventory across both warehouses. The cost per unit for distributing goods to warehouse $X$ is \$2 while it's \$3 for warehouse $Y$, with the aim being to minimize overall distribution costs while meeting all constraints(X,Y are integers). Find out what would be the minimum total distribution cost in dollars, rounded off to nearest dollar.
