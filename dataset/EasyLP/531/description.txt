A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources among three different projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The projects could involve expanding network coverage ($X$), upgrading security infrastructure ($Y$), and implementing new technologies ($Z$). The costs associated with each project are 2, 3, and 1 units for $X, Y$, and $Z$, respectively. The aim is to minimize the total cost while adhering to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n\n- The combined allocation of resources for projects $X$ and $Y$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- To ensure balanced development across all areas, the sum of twice the allocation for project $X$ and the allocation for project $Z$ should be at least 500 units.\n- Furthermore, a difference of exactly 200 units must exist between resource allocations for projects $Y$ and $Z$, reflecting specific requirements of these two projects.\n- Additionally, the sum of resource allocations for projects $X$ and $Z$ should not exceed 800 units.\n\nGiven these conditions as well as the requirement that all allocations are in whole numbers due to operational practicalities, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
