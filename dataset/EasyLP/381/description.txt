A sports team manager is planning the allocation of weekly training hours for four different groups within the team: group X1 focuses on strength conditioning, group X2 on skill development, group X3 on strategy and tactics, and group X4 on recovery. The objective is to optimize the team's performance by minimizing the total fatigue score, which is affected by the training intensity and duration for each group. The fatigue scores associated with each hour of training are 5 for group X1, 4 for group X2, 3 for group X3, and 6 for group X4.\n\nThe team has the following constraints for their weekly training schedule:- The combined hours of strength conditioning (group X1) and skill development (group X2) cannot exceed 15 hours.- To achieve a balanced training program, the sum of skill development (group X2) hours and strategy and tactics (group X3) hours must be at least 10.- Additionally, to prevent overtraining or injuries, the difference in hours between strategy and tactics (group X3) and recovery (group x4) must be no more than 8.- Furthermore, due to certain strategic objectives that emphasize physicality this season, there should be at least five more hours dedicated to strength conditioning (X1) compared to twice the recovery time(X4).\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of training hours due to scheduling practicalities(the maximum allowed time per week is defined well in this question), what is the minimum total fatigue score given an optimal allocation of weekly training hours among all four groups? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
