In a manufacturing scenario, a factory manager needs to balance the allocation of raw materials and labor costs to optimize production. The cost per unit for raw materials is $5 and for labor is $10. Given that both allocations should be in whole numbers due to practical considerations, there are certain constraints that must be adhered to:\n\n- To ensure quality and efficiency, the combined total of twice the amount of raw materials and thrice the labor cost must not fall below 20 units.\n- To maintain balance between resources used, the difference between raw materials and labor cost cannot exceed 30 units.\n- Due to budgetary restrictions, the sum of raw materials and labor cost has been fixed at exactly 100 units.\n\nThe question is: What is the minimum total cost in dollars needed to meet these requirements? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
