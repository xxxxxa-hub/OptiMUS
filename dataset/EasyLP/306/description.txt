An environmental agency is planning to allocate funds between three projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These projects could involve pollution control, renewable energy initiatives, and climate change research, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 2, 3, and 4 units for $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:- The combined fund allocation for all three projects cannot exceed 100 units.- Twice the allocation for project X minus the allocation for project Y must be at least 20 units.- The combined fund allocation for projects Y and Z cannot exceed 70 units.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the requirement that allocations for each of the projects should be whole numbers due to monetary limitations. Also considering that each project has specific bounds on resource allocation i.e., Project X can receive a maximum of 50 units of funds, Project Y can receive a maximum of 40 units while there are no upper bounds set for project Z:\nWhat is the minimum total cost (in unit currency) that the agency needs to allocate across all three projects in order to meet all given conditions? Please provide your answer rounded off to nearest integer.
