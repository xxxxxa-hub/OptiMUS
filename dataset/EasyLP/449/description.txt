A telecommunications company is planning to invest in two new projects: Project X and Project Y. These projects involve upgrading network infrastructure and expanding service coverage respectively. The objective is to minimize the total investment cost, which are $\$500$ per unit for Project X and $\$1000$ per unit for Project Y.\n\nThe investments must adhere to the following conditions due to budget, manpower, and technology limitations:\n- Five times the investment in Project X along with twice the investment in Project Y should meet or exceed a minimum requirement of 10 units.\n- The combined investments of three times Project X and four times Project Y should not exceed a maximum limit of 25 units.\n- The investment difference between Projects X and Y should be at least one unit, ensuring balanced resource distribution.\n\nGiven these constraints, both investments in Projects X and Y are constrained within specific bounds (X between 0 to 7 units inclusive; Y between 0 to 5 units inclusive) as well as being integers due to indivisible nature of resources:\nWhat would be the minimum total investment cost for the company while optimally allocating resources among both projects within their specified bounds? Please round your answer off to nearest whole number.
