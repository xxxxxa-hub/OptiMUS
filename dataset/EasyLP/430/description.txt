A transportation company is planning to allocate its resources between two types of services, X and Y. The total resources available for both services combined cannot exceed 20 units due to logistical constraints. To meet the customer demand, the sum of the resources allocated to service X and twice that for service Y must be at least 10 units. Additionally, the difference in resources between twice that of service X and service Y should not exceed 15 units to maintain operational balance.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource for service X is 5 units and for service Y is 4 units. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints, given that the allocations are integers due to the nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this operation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
