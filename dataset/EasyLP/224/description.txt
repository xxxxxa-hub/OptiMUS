A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources between three projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, and implementing new technologies respectively. The total resource allocation across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined effort of these projects must adhere to two rules: the sum of twice the resources allocated for project $X$ and those allocated for project $Y$ should be at least 500 units; the sum of resources allocated for project $X$ and thrice those allocated for project $Z$ should not exceed 800 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocation in projects $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ has different costs associated with it, quantified as \$10, \$15, and \$20 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints (assuming that resource allocations are whole numbers due to their indivisible nature).\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar?
