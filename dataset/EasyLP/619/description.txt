A project manager is planning the scheduling of four tasks: X1, X2, X3, and X4. Each task needs to be completed in a whole number of hours due to the nature of the tasks. The total time for each task is constrained as follows:\n\n- Task X1 cannot exceed 10 hours.\n- Task X2 cannot exceed 15 hours.\n- Task X3 cannot exceed 20 hours.\n- Task X4 cannot exceed 25 hours.\n\nThere are also constraints regarding combined task durations due to interdependencies between tasks:\n\n- The combined duration of tasks X1 and X2 should not exceed 8 hours, perhaps due to shared resources or personnel.\n- The combined duration of tasks X2 and X3 should not exceed 12 hours, possibly because they involve some common elements that need coordinated effort.\n- The combined duration of tasks X3 and X4 should be at least 14 hours, reflecting a requirement for substantial overlapping work on these two phases.\n\nAdditionally, there are specific balance requirements between certain tasks:\n\n- Twice the duration allocated to task X2 minus that for task X1 and task x3 should not surpass -6 hours.\n-The difference between the durations allocated to task x3 and half that allocated to task x4 must be at least equal to that assigned to task x2. \nThe associated cost per hour for each task are $10$, $20$, $30$ and $40$ respectively for tasks $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ and $X4$. Given these conditions, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded off to the nearest dollar.
