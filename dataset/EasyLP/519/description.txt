A transportation manager is planning to distribute the transportation capacity among three routes: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These routes could represent different geographical areas or different types of cargo. The total capacity across all three routes cannot exceed 500 units due to constraints in fleet size. Route $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 100 units to maintain service levels, while route $Y$ needs at least 150 units due to higher demand. Route $Z$, on the other hand, requires a minimum allocation of 200 units because it covers a larger area.\n\nEach unit of capacity allocated to routes $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as 5 , 10 , and 15 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that allocations are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of vehicle capacities.\n\nIn addition, each route has its specific bounds on capacity allocation:\n- Route X: between 0 and 300 units\n- Route Y: between 0 and 400 units\n- Route Z: between 0 and 600 units\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
