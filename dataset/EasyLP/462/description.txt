In a supply chain optimization scenario, a company is planning to distribute resources between two warehouses, $X$ and $Y$. The total resources allocated to both warehouses combined cannot exceed 1000 units due to logistics constraints. To meet the delivery needs, the combined storage capacity of three times warehouse $X$ plus twice warehouse $Y$ should be at least 2500 units. In addition, the difference in resource allocation between warehouse $X$ and warehouse $Y$ must not exceed 300 units for operational balance. Each unit of resource costs $\$7$ in warehouse X and $\$5$ in warehouse Y. Given that all resource allocations are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated and each warehouse has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this operation, given an optimal distribution of resources within these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
