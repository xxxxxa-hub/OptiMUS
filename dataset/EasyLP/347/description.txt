A financial manager is planning to allocate a total investment of \$10,000,000 across four different projects: X, Y, Z and W. The projects have expected returns per dollar invested of 5%, 7%, 6% and 8% respectively. The allocations must be in whole dollars due to the nature of the investments.\n\nThe following constraints are placed on the allocation:\n- Project X requires a minimum investment of \$2,000,000.\n- Project Y cannot receive more than \$5,000,000 due to risk management considerations.\n- Project Z requires a minimum investment of \$1,500,000 due to contractual obligations.\n- Project W can only handle up to \$3,000,000 in funding.\n\nWhat is the minimum total return from these investments that can be achieved while meeting all these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
