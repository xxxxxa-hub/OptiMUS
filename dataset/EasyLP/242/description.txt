A construction company is planning to allocate resources across three types of projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total number of projects that can be handled is limited to 50 due to manpower constraints. To meet a strategic objective, the combined effectiveness score calculated as 3 times the number of X projects plus 4 times the number of Y projects and 5 times the number of Z projects must be at least 150. Furthermore, there should not be more than a difference of 10 between the numbers of project type X and project type Y.\n\nEach project type incurs different costs: Each unit (project) in $X$ costs \$2000, each unit in $Y$ costs \$3000, and each unit in $Z$ costs \$4000. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Also note that since a project cannot be fractioned, only whole numbers are acceptable for each project type.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario in dollars? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
