A farmer has four different types of crops (x1, x2, x3, and x4) that he can plant on his farm. Each type of crop requires a specific amount of resources to grow and yields a certain profit. The farmer's goal is to maximize his profit while ensuring that the resource constraints are met. The cost for planting each type of crop is as follows: - Crop x1 costs 5 units per acre.- Crop x2 costs 3 units per acre.- Crop x3 costs 7 units per acre.- Crop x4 costs 6 units per acre.The farmer has the following resource constraints:- Twice the resources used for crop x1 and thrice those for crop x2 cannot exceed 50 units due to limited fertilizer availability.- Four times the resources used for crop x1 along with those used for crop x3 cannot surpass 40 units because of limited water supply.- Five times the resources allocated to crop x4 should be at least 10 more than those allocated to crop x2 due to specific soil requirements.- The difference between the total resources used for crops (x1, and X2) and those used for crops (x3, and X4) should be zero, maintaining an ecological balance.Also note that each type of crop has a maximum limit on how much can be planted due to land restrictions:-Crop X1: up to 100 acres-Crop X2: up to 200 acres-Crop X3: up to 150 acres-Crop X4: up to 120 acresGiven these conditions, what is the minimum cost in units for planting these crops in whole numbers of acres? Please round your answer off to nearest integer.
