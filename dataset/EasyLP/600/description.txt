In a financial portfolio management scenario, an investment manager needs to allocate funds across four different assets: $X1, X2, X3$, and $X4$. These could represent investments in various financial instruments such as bonds, stocks, mutual funds or derivatives. The total investment across all four assets cannot exceed \$100000 due to budget constraints. Asset $X1$ requires a minimum investment of \$10000 and a maximum of \$60000, while asset $X2$ has an allowable range from \$20000 to \$80000. Asset $X3$ requires an investment ranging between \$15000 and \$50000. For asset $X4$, the minimum investment is \$200 with no upper limit.\n\nThe manager also needs to ensure that the following conditions are met:\n- The difference between 60% of the investment in asset X1 and 40% of the investment in asset X2 must be non-negative.\n- The sum of investments in assets X3 and X4 should not be less than the combined investments in assets X1 and X2 by more than \$30000.\n- The difference between 70% of the investment in asset X3 and 50% of the investment in asset X4 should not exceed \$500.\n\nEach unit invested in assets $X1, X2, X3$, and $X4$ incurs costs at rates of 0.05 , 0.08 , 0.12 , and 0.15 respectively. Given these conditions, calculate the minimum total cost for managing this portfolio (round your answer to two decimal places), given that all investments are integer multiples of one dollar.
