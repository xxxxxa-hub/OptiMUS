A real estate developer is planning to invest in three types of properties: residential (x), commercial (y), and industrial (z). Each type of property has a different rate of return per unit investment, being \$100 for residential, \$200 for commercial, and \$300 for industrial. The total investment cannot exceed 50 units due to budget constraints. In addition, the combined investment in twice as many residential properties plus commercial ones must be at least 30 units to ensure diversification. Also, the sum of investments in commercial and industrial properties cannot surpass 20 units due to regulatory or risk management considerations.\n\nGiven these constraints and aiming for whole numbers of unit investments due to the indivisible nature of property units, along with specific bounds on each type of investment:\nWhat is the minimum possible return from these investments given an optimal allocation strategy? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
