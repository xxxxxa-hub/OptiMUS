In a healthcare setting, a hospital administrator is planning to allocate funds between two important departments: Department X, which focuses on critical care, and Department Y, which handles general patient services. The total budget for both departments combined cannot exceed 200 units due to financial constraints. However, it is required that at least 50 units must be allocated to Department X and at least 30 units to Department Y to ensure essential operations in both departments.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of allocation is different for the two departments. For department X it costs \$5000 per unit and for department Y it costs \$8000 per unit. The objective is to minimize the total expenditure while meeting all the requirements.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of units due to budgeting practicalities, calculate the minimum total expenditure required given the optimal allocation of funds among Departments X and Y? Provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
