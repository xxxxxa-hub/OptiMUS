A Human Resources manager at a company is planning to hire new employees for two different positions: Position $X$ and Position $Y$. Due to budget constraints, the total number of new hires cannot exceed 10. The position X requires a minimum of 3 hires to meet operational requirements, while position Y requires at least 2 hires due to regulatory requirements. Each hire for position X costs the company $\$50,000$, while each hire for position Y costs $\$40,000$. However, there are also capacity constraints: the maximum number of hires for position X is 7 and for position Y it's 8.\n\nGiven that all hiring decisions must be in whole numbers (as you can't hire a fraction of an employee), what is the minimum possible total hiring cost (in dollars) under these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
