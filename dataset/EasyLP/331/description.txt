A marketing manager is planning to allocate a budget across four different channels: Advertising, PR, Online Marketing, and Offline Marketing. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these channels, with costs being $5 per unit for Advertising, $2 per unit for PR, $3 per unit for Online Marketing, and $4 per unit for Offline Marketing.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic requirements:\n- The combined budget allocation for Advertising and PR cannot exceed 10000 units.\n- The combined budget allocation for Online Marketing and Offline Marketing must be at least 2000 units.\n- The difference between the budgets of Advertising and Online Marketing should not exceed 5000 units.\n- The difference between the budgets of PR and Offline Marketing should not be less than -1000 units.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the requirement that all allocations must be whole numbers due to accounting regulations. Each channel also has an upper limit on resource allocation: Advertising can receive no more than 6000 units; PR can receive no more than 4000 units; Online Marketing can receive no more than 3000 units; Offline marketing can receive no more than 7000 units. What is the minimum total cost in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar?
