A tourism agency is planning to allocate resources between two promotional strategies: strategy $X$ and strategy $Y$. The total resource allocation for both strategies combined cannot exceed 200 units due to budget constraints. To achieve the desired reach, the combined effort of these strategies must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as twice the resources allocated to strategy X plus the resources allocated to strategy Y, of at least 150 points. Additionally, the difference in resource allocation between strategy X and Y cannot be more than 50 units to maintain balance in promotional efforts. Each unit of resource allocated to strategies $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of 50 and 80 units respectively. The agency aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (note that X and Y are integers). What is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this operation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
