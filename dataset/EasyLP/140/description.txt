In a military logistics operation, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units, X and Y. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the units. The total resource points that can be allocated to 2 units of X and 3 units of Y cannot exceed 50 due to logistical constraints. Moreover, the combined strength of 5 units of X and one unit of Y must be at least 10. In addition, there is another constraint stating that the difference in allocated resource points between unit X and unit Y should not exceed 5.\n\nEach unit of X requires $\$10000$ and each unit of Y requires $\$20000$. The commander aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this operation? Note: The values are given in thousands (e.g., if your answer is $25$, it means $25000$), rounded to the nearest whole number.
