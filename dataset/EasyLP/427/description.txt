A transportation manager needs to allocate cargo capacity between two types of freight, $X$ and $Y$. Due to the nature of the freight, allocations must be whole numbers. The total cargo capacity for both types combined cannot exceed 500 units due to vehicle constraints. Type $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 200 units to be feasible, while type $Y$ requires at least 100 units. Each unit of cargo for type $X$ and type $Y$ incurs costs of 0.05 and 0.1 units respectively, with the objective being to minimize these costs while meeting all other constraints. What is the minimum total cost for this operation? Please provide your answer rounded to one decimal place.
