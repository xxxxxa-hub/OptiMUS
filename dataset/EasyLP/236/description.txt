A farmer is planning to plant three types of crops: wheat, corn, and soybeans. The cost of planting each crop differs; it costs \$20 per acre for wheat, \$30 per acre for corn, and \$10 per acre for soybeans. There are several constraints the farmer must adhere to when deciding how many acres to devote to each crop:\n\n- The combined area planted with wheat and corn cannot exceed 200 acres due to space limitations.\n- To maintain a healthy crop rotation cycle, the total area planted with twice as much wheat as soybeans must be at least 150 acres.\n- The difference in area between corn and soybeans cannot be more than 100 acres.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of acres due to practicalities of land division, what is the minimum total cost for planting these crops?
