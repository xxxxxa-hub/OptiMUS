A construction company is planning to allocate resources between two major projects: Project X and Project Y. Each project requires different amounts of a particular resource, with Project X requiring $5000 units per hour and Project Y requiring $3000 units per hour. The total resource allocation for both projects cannot exceed 20 hours due to limited availability. To meet the company's strategic objectives, the combined effort of three times the resources allocated to Project X minus four times that of Project Y must be at least 5 hours. In addition, the sum of twice the resources allocated to Project X and those allocated to Project Y should exactly equal 10 hours.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering that resource allocation can only be in whole numbers due to practical reasons, calculate the minimum total amount of resources required for both projects within their respective bounds (0-15 hours for project X and 0-10 hours for project Y). Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number in terms of unit-hours.
