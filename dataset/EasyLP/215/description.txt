A retail manager is planning to allocate resources across three different departments: purchasing (X), sales (Y), and logistics (Z). These departments have different cost per unit of resource allocated, with $5 for X, $3 for Y, and $4 for Z. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting certain operational constraints.\n\nThe combined resources allocated to purchasing and sales cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget limitations. Similarly, the combined resources allocated to sales and logistics cannot exceed 800 units due to manpower availability. To ensure a balanced operation, the difference in resource allocation between purchasing and logistics should be at least 200 units.\n\nGiven that each department has specific bounds on resource allocation (Purchasing can have up to 500 units, Sales up to 300 units, Logistics up to 200 units) and that allocations must be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of the resources being allocated:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
