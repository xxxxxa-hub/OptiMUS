In a healthcare scenario, a hospital administrator needs to allocate resources between two departments: X and Y. The total number of units allocated to department X and three times the units allocated to department Y should be at least 10 to ensure essential services are maintained. Furthermore, due to budgetary constraints, twice the units given to department X plus the units for department Y cannot exceed 30.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to departments X and Y has different costs associated with it: 4 and 5 respectively. The administrator's goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring all constraints are met. Given that allocations must be in whole numbers because they represent complete units of resources:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this allocation, rounded off to the nearest whole number?
