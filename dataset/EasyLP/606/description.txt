A retail store manager is planning to allocate resources across four different departments: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These could represent departments like clothing, electronics, groceries, and home decor. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these departments, with costs being 2, 3, 4, and 5 units for each unit of resource allocated to $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limits, space considerations or strategic priorities:\n- The combined resource allocation for departments $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The total resources allocated between departments $x3$ and $x4$ must be at least 500 units reflecting their critical importance in the store's offerings.\n- Twice the resources dedicated to department x1 should not fall short of half the resources dedicated to department x3 by less than 300 units, ensuring a balance between these two areas.\n- The difference between the combined allocations for departments x1 and x2 minus that for department x4 should not exceed 400 units in order to maintain an overall balance in resource distribution.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the requirement that all allocations must be whole numbers due to indivisibility of certain resources (like manpower or floor space), each department also has specific bounds on resource allocation ranging from 0 up to a maximum limit which varies by department:\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost given optimal resource allocation within specified bounds? Please round your answer off to nearest whole number.
