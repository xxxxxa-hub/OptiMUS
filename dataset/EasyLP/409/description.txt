A real estate developer is planning to invest in four different types of properties: residential (x1), commercial (x2), industrial (x3), and retail (x4). The objective is to minimize the total investment cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$200,000, \$300,000, \$500,000 and \$700,000 for each unit of x1, x2, x3 and x4 respectively. \n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and local zoning laws:- The combined units of residential and commercial properties cannot exceed 50.- The sum of twice the number of industrial properties plus retail properties should be at least 60.- Three times the number of residential properties plus four point five times commercial properties should not exceed 100 units.- Six times the number of industrial properties minus half a unit of retail property should not surpass 80 units.\n\nGiven that there are bounds on how much can be invested in each type of property:\nResidential(x1): Up to 20 units\nCommercial(x2): Up to 30 units\nIndustrial(x3): Up to 15 units\nRetail(x4): Up to 10 units \nAnd all investments must be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of property units. What would be minimum total investment cost required for this scenario rounded off to nearest whole dollar?
