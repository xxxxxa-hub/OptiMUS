A financial advisor is developing an investment strategy for a client. The portfolio consists of two types of bonds (Bond1 and Bond2) and two types of stocks (Stock1 and Stock2). The objective is to minimize the total risk associated with the portfolio, with risks being 2, 3, 4, and 5 units for Bond1, Bond2, Stock1, and Stock2 respectively.\n\nThe investment plan must adhere to the following constraints due to the client's risk tolerance and diversification guidelines:\n- The total investment in bonds (Bond1 and Bond2 combined) cannot exceed $10,000.\n- The total investment in stocks (Stock1 and Stock2 combined) cannot exceed $5,000.\n- To ensure a balanced portfolio that doesn't heavily favor one type of asset over another, the investment in Bond1 must be at least $2000 more than that in Stock1.\n- Similarly, to maintain balance between different types of assets within each category, the amount invested in Stock2 must exceed that invested in Bond2 by at least $1000.\n\nGiven these conditions along with individual bounds on investments for each asset type due to market conditions or regulatory requirements,\nThe question is: What is the minimum total risk score for this investment strategy given optimal allocation across all four assets? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
