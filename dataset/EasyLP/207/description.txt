A healthcare administrator is planning the distribution of a limited budget among three critical areas: patient care (X), medical research (Y), and hospital maintenance (Z). The total budget cannot exceed \$10,000 due to financial constraints. Each area has its own minimum funding requirements: patient care requires at least \$2,000, medical research needs a minimum of \$1,500, and hospital maintenance requires at least \$500. The cost effectiveness for each dollar spent in these areas are 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2 respectively.\n\nThe aim is to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints and ensuring that the allocations are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of monetary units.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars required under this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
