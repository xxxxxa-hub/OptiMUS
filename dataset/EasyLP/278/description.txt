A sports coach is planning the weekly training schedule for three groups of athletes: group X focuses on strength training, group Y on agility drills, and group Z on strategic game planning. The number of sessions assigned to each group must be a whole number due to scheduling practicalities. Furthermore, the total hours allocated per week are constrained as follows:\n\n- The combined number of sessions for strength training (group X) and agility drills (group Y) should be at least 6.\n- The difference between the number of sessions dedicated to agility drills (group Y) and strategic game planning (group Z) should not exceed 1, maintaining a balanced approach in physical and mental preparation.\n- The combined number of sessions for strength training (group X) and strategic game planning (group Z) cannot exceed 8, ensuring that athletes are not overworked.\n\nEach session with groups X, Y, and Z yields fatigue scores which affect the athletes' recovery times; these scores are respectively 4, 2, and 3 units per session. The coach aims to minimize total fatigue while adhering to all constraints mentioned above.\n\nGiven that each group has specific bounds on session allocation due to available resources: What is the minimum total fatigue score that can be achieved given optimal session allocation across the three groups? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
