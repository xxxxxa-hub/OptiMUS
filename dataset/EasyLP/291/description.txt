In an education scenario, a university needs to allocate resources across three departments: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different faculties or research areas. The total resource allocation across all three departments cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Department $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 200 units for its programs and operations, while department $Y$ needs at least 150 units. Department $Z$, on the other hand, requires a minimum of 120 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to departments $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as 10 , 20 , and 30 units respectively. The university aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to the resource constraints for each department and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number.
