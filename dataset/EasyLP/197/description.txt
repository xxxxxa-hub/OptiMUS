A financial manager is planning the allocation of a budget across three investment portfolios: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total amount allocated across all three portfolios cannot exceed $\$50000$. Portfolio $X$ requires an allocation that is at least $\$10000$ more than portfolio $Y$, and portfolio $Y$ requires an allocation that is at least $\$5000$ more than portfolio $Z$. Each dollar invested in portfolios $X, Y,$ and $Z$ incurs costs of $\$1000, \$800,$ and $\$600$, respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints, ensuring all investments are in whole dollars due to accounting standards. What is the minimum total cost for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar?
