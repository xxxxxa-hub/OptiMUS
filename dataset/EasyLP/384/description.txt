In a sports team, the coach is planning to allocate hours for four different training areas: x1 (strength and conditioning), x2 (skill development), x3 (strategy learning), and x4 (recovery sessions). The cost per hour of each area are $20$, $30$, $50$ and $60$ respectively. Due to the nature of the activities, only whole number allocations are feasible.\n\nThe following constraints apply:- The combined hours of strength and conditioning (x1) and skill development (x2) must be at least 5.- The difference between strategy learning (x3) and recovery sessions (x4) cannot exceed 10 hours, ensuring balance between learning new strategies and recovering from intense training.- Twice the hours of strength and conditioning plus three times skill development minus recovery session should be at least 8, reflecting the importance of these areas in overall player performance.- The difference between strength and conditioning (x1) hours and strategy learning(x3) should not exceed 6, emphasizing the need for a strong physical foundation for effective strategy execution.\n\nEach activity has specific bounds on allocation due to available resources:Strength & Conditioning: [0,15] Skill Development: [0,12] Strategy Learning: [0,10] Recovery Sessions: [0,8]\n\nGiven these conditions what would be the minimum total cost for optimal allocation among all four areas rounded to nearest dollar?
