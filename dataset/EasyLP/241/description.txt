A construction company is planning the allocation of resources to three types of projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent residential, commercial, and infrastructure projects respectively. The total number of projects that can be handled simultaneously is limited to 20 due to workforce constraints. To maintain a diverse portfolio, the combined number of residential (project X) and half the commercial (project Y) projects must be at least 5. Furthermore, due to specific expertise requirements, the combined number of commercial (project Y) and infrastructure (project Z) projects cannot exceed 10.\n\nEach type of project incurs different costs: $\$1000$ for each residential project (X), $\$2000$ for each commercial project (Y), and $\$1500$ for each infrastructure project (Z). The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Given that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of individual projects:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required under these conditions? Provide your answer in dollars rounded off to the nearest whole dollar.
