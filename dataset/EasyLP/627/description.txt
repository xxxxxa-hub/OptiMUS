In a human resources scenario, a company needs to allocate employees across four departments: $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ and $X4$. The cost associated with each employee in these departments are $\$5000$, $\$4000$, $\$6000$ and $\$7000$ respectively. \n\nThe following constraints exist due to staffing requirements:\n- The combined number of employees in department $X1$ and department $X2$ should be at least 10.\n- The total number of employees in department $X3$ and department $X4$ should not exceed 20.\n- The difference between twice the number of employees in department $X2$, the number of employees in department $X1$, and the number of employees in department X3 should be at least 5.\n- The difference between the number of employees in department X4, the number of employees in department X1, and the number of employees in Department X2 should be at least 5.\n\nAdditionally, there are specific bounds on the number of staff each department can accommodate. Departments X1, X2, X3, and X4 can have up to 30, 40, 50, and 60 staff members respectively. All staffing numbers must be whole numbers due to practical considerations.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost for this staffing scenario (in dollars), given optimal allocation within these bounds? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
