A shipping company is deciding on how to allocate their transportation resources between two ports, Port $X$ and Port $Y$. The total capacity that can be handled by both ports combined is limited to 2000 units, with every unit shipped to port $X$ taking up 4 units of capacity and every unit shipped to port $Y$ taking up 5 units. To maintain a balanced distribution network, the number of shipments sent to port $X$ should exceed those sent to port $Y$ by at least 50 units. However, due to logistical constraints, the combined shipment volume of port $X$ and twice that of port $Y$ cannot exceed 1500 units. Each shipment sent to Port X and Y costs the company \$2 and \$3 respectively.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of shipments due to practical reasons, find the minimum total cost in dollars for this allocation while adhering to all constraints.
