A real estate investor is considering three types of properties: residential ($x$), commercial ($y$), and industrial ($z$). The cost per unit of investment in these property types are \$300, \$200, and \$500 respectively. Due to budget constraints, the total number of units invested across all three property types cannot exceed 50.\n\nIn addition, the investor has a certain return on investment (ROI) goal that must be met. This ROI is calculated as 5 times the number of residential units plus 3 times the number of commercial units plus 10 times the number of industrial units. The combined ROI from all investments must be at least 100.\n\nMoreover, due to market conditions or personal preference, the investor wishes to have at least as many residential units as commercial ones (i.e., $x - y \geq 0$).\n\nAssuming that investments can only be made in whole numbers of units due to the indivisible nature of real estate properties. What is the minimum possible total cost for this investor's portfolio given these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
