A farmer is planning to allocate his land for the cultivation of four crops: Wheat, Corn, Rice and Barley. The total land area available for Wheat and Corn combined cannot exceed 500 acres due to soil suitability. Similarly, the combined area allocated for Rice and Barley cannot exceed 600 acres because of water availability constraints. The area planted with Wheat must be at least 100 acres more than that used for Rice in order to ensure crop diversity and reduce disease risk. Additionally, the area cultivated with Corn must be at least 200 acres greater than that planted with Barley due to market demand considerations.\n\nThe costs associated with cultivating each acre are $10 for Wheat, $20 for Corn, $30 for Rice and $40 for Barley. These costs reflect a combination of seed cost, labor requirements and other expenses related to each crop's cultivation.\n\nGiven these conditions, along with the fact that the farmer can only cultivate whole numbers of acres due to practical considerations such as machinery compatibility and irrigation system setup. Moreover each crop has specific bounds on land allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars given the optimal allocation of his land among these four crops (Wheat, Corn, Rice and Barley), rounded to nearest dollar?
