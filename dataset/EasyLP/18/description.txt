A green energy company is planning to expand its power generation capacity by investing in solar and wind energy projects. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these investments. The cost per unit of capacity for solar and wind energy projects are \$50 and \$60 respectively.\n\nThe company must adhere to the following constraints due to budget, manpower, and technology limitations:- The combined capacity from both solar and wind energy projects must be at least 1000 units.- The capacity from three times the solar energy projects minus that from wind energy cannot exceed 500 units, reflecting specific project requirements.\n\nGiven these conditions, along with the requirement that the capacities for both solar and wind energy projects must be whole numbers due to practical considerations:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for the company, given the optimal allocation of resources to both solar and wind energy projects? Provide your answer in dollars, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
