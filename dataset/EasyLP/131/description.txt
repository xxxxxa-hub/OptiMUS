An environmental organization is planning to allocate funds between two projects: project $X$ focuses on reforestation and project $Y$ focuses on ocean cleanup. The total budget for both projects combined cannot exceed $\$10000$. To achieve their mission, the combined impact score of these projects, calculated as 10 times the budget for project X plus 4 times the budget for project Y, must be at least 40000 points. Each dollar spent on projects $X$ and $Y$ yields different returns or costs in terms of environmental impact, quantified as 50 and 30 points per dollar respectively. The organization aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints and ensuring that the budgets for both X and Y are integers due to accounting regulations. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario in dollars, rounded to the nearest whole number.
