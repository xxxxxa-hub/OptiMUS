A tourism company is planning to allocate their budget between two projects: $X$ and $Y$, which could represent different types of tours or destinations. The total budget for both projects combined cannot exceed 200 units due to financial constraints. To ensure a diverse portfolio, the company wants the combined weighted impact score (0.6 times the budget for project X plus 0.8 times the budget for project Y) to be at least 120 units. Moreover, the difference in budgets between project $X$ and project $Y$ should not exceed 50 units in favor of project $X$ to maintain a balanced investment strategy.\n\nThe cost per unit of effectiveness for projects $X$ and $Y$ are 50 and 80 units respectively, with the aim being to minimize this total cost while adhering to all constraints. Each project has specific upper limits on resource allocation, with a maximum of 150 units allocated towards project X and a maximum of 100 units towards project Y due to operational limitations.\n\nGiven that all allocations must be whole numbers due to accounting requirements, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded up to the nearest whole number?
