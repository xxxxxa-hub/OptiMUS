An environmental protection organization has three projects: Project X focuses on air pollution, Project Y on water pollution and Project Z on land pollution. The objective is to minimize the total cost of these projects while ensuring their effectiveness. The costs associated with each project are \$1000 for Project X, \$500 for Project Y, and \$1200 for Project Z per unit.\n\nThe organization has certain constraints regarding the allocation of resources among these projects:\n\n- The total units allocated across all three projects cannot exceed 100 due to budgetary limitations.\n- To ensure a balance between different types of environmental issues, the units allocated to Project X must be at least 10 more than those allocated to Project Y.\n- Similarly, the units allocated to Project Z should not exceed those allocated to Project Y by more than 20 units.\n\nGiven that resource allocations must be in whole numbers due to administrative requirements and that there are specific bounds on resource allocation for each project (X can range from 0-50 units, Y from 0-40 units, and Z from 0-60 units):\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario given optimal allocation of resources? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
