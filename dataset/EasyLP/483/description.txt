An environmental organization is planning to allocate resources to two projects, X and Y, which focus on air quality improvement and water conservation respectively. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the resources. The total resource points that can be allocated between project X and project Y are constrained by a maximum of 100 units with respect to 4 times for project X and 5 times for project Y due to budget limitations. To ensure sufficient impact on both fronts, the combined allocation for these projects must not be less than 20 units. Furthermore, in order to maintain a balanced approach towards both issues, the difference between twice the allocation for project X and that for project Y should not exceed 30 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to projects X and Y incurs different costs: Project X requires 6 units per resource while Project Y only needs 2 units per resource. The organization aims to minimize its total cost while meeting all constraints. Find the minimum total cost in terms of unit cost required by this organization under given conditions.
