A shipping company has two types of cargo, $X$ and $Y$, that need to be transported. The total weight capacity of the ship is limited to 30 tons, where each unit of cargo $X$ weighs 2 tons and each unit of cargo $Y$ weighs 3 tons. To fulfill a certain contract, the combined weight of 4 units of cargo $X$ and one unit of cargo $Y$ must be at least 10 tons. Each unit of cargo type $X$ costs \$5 to transport while each unit of cargo type $Y$ costs \$7. The company aims to minimize its transportation cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of units for both X and Y are integers due to the indivisible nature of the cargoes. What is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this operation? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
