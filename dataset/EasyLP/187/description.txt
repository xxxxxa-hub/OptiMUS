A manufacturing company produces three products, denoted by $x1$, $x2$, and $x3$. Each product requires different amounts of three types of resources. Specifically, product $x1$ consumes 5 units of resource A, 4 units of resource B per unit produced. Product $x2$ requires 3 units of resource A and 6 units of resource B per unit produced. Similarly, product $x3$ needs 8 units of resource A and 7 units of resource B for each unit manufactured.\n\nThe total availability for resources A and B are 1000 and 800 units respectively. Moreover, to meet a specific demand requirement, the production level represented by the expression: (number of $x1$ - twice the number of $x2$ + number of $x3$) must be at least equal to a value of 100.\n\nThe cost associated with producing a single unit is \\$10 for product $x1$, \\$15 for product $x2$, and \\$20 for product $x3$. The production levels must be whole numbers due to the nature of the manufacturing process.\n\nGiven these conditions along with additional constraints on individual production levels that dictate maximums allowable (300 units for x1, 200 units for x2, and 150 units for x3), what is the minimum total cost needed to meet these constraints?
