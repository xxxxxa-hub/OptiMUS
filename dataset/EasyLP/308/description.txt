A military operation requires the allocation of resources across three types of units: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total number of units that can be deployed cannot exceed 10000 due to logistical constraints. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined effectiveness of these units, calculated as 5 times the number of X units plus 3 times the number of Y units plus 7 times the number of Z units, must be at least 20000. Additionally, there are two more tactical considerations in this planning process: firstly, the number of X units should not be less than that of Y; secondly, the number of Z units should not exceed that of Y.\n\nEach unit type incurs different costs: each unit from X costs \$500, from Y costs \$300 and from Z costs \$700. The objective is to minimize these total deployment costs while ensuring all other conditions are met and considering that only whole numbers of each unit can be deployed due to their indivisible nature.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this military operation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
