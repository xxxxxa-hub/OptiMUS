A tourism manager is planning to allocate resources for two tour packages: X and Y. Each package needs a certain number of buses and guides, which are the main resources in this context. The total resource constraints are such that twice the resources for package X plus thrice the resources for package Y cannot exceed 50 units. To meet a minimum threshold of services offered, at least 10 units of combined resources should be allocated to both packages together. Additionally, due to logistical constraints, the difference in resources between package X and package Y must not exceed 20 units.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource is $100$ for package $X$ and $200$ for package $Y$. Given these conditions, if we consider the indivisibility of buses and guides (i.e., they can't be split into fractions), hence both X and Y must be integers:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required to allocate resources optimally among the two tour packages? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
