A construction company is planning to allocate resources between two types of projects: X and Y. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the units. To fulfill a certain contract, the combined strength of 2 units of X and 3 units of Y must be at least 10. Moreover, total number of projects cannot exceed 8 due to limited manpower availability. Additionally, it's required that project Y should always have at least one more unit than project X for maintaining balance in type of work.\n\nThe cost per unit for each type of project is different with Project X costing \$5000 and Project Y costing \$7000. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints within given bounds (X can range from 0-5 units and Y can range from 0-4 units). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this operation in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar.
