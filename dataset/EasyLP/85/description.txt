A manager is scheduling shifts for two types of workers: type $X$ and type $Y$. The total number of shifts that must be scheduled is at least 10 to ensure all tasks are covered. To maintain a balanced workload, the number of shifts for type X workers should not exceed twice the number of shifts for type Y workers by more than 4.\n\nEach shift for a worker of type $X$ costs \$8 in wages, while each shift for a worker of type $Y$ costs \$5. All shift numbers are integers due to the nature of scheduling. The manager aims to minimize the total wage cost while meeting these constraints.\n\nWhat is the minimum total wage cost required for this schedule, rounded to the nearest dollar?
