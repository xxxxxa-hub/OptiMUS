A city's transportation department needs to allocate resources for four projects: X1, X2, X3, and X4. These projects could involve improving road infrastructure, expanding public transport coverage, developing cycling lanes and pedestrian paths, and implementing traffic management systems respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects with costs being 4, 5, 6 and 7 units for each project X1, X2, X3 and X4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for Project X1 and Project X2 cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The sum of resource allocations for Project X2 and Project X3 must be at least 800 units in order to maintain a balanced investment strategy.\n- The difference between the allocations for Projects X3 and X4 must exactly equal to 200 units due to specific project requirements.\n- Half of the resources allocated for project x4 minus those allocated for x1 should not exceed 300 units.\n\nGiven these conditions as well as the requirement that all allocations are integers (due to indivisibility of resources), along with specified bounds on resource allocation per project:\nWhat is the minimum total cost that allows optimal resource allocation across all four projects? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
