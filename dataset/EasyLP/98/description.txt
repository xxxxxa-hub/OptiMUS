In a human resources scenario, a company is planning to allocate its training budget between two groups of employees: group $X$ and group $Y$. The total budget available for both groups combined cannot exceed $\$50,000$, and the company wants to ensure that the allocation supports its strategic objectives. To do this, it has set a constraint that the amount allocated to group $X$, when multiplied by three, minus the amount allocated to group $Y$ must be at least $\$10,000$. The cost of training per employee in group $X$ is $\$5,000$, while for those in group $Y$, it is $\$7,000$. Due to resource limitations and program capacity constraints, no more than 40 employees from group X and 20 employees from group Y can participate in the training. Considering these constraints and aiming for an integer number of participants due to practical reasons (as you can't train a fraction of an employee), what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
