A military operation is planning the deployment of resources across three units: X, Y, and Z. The total number of resources that can be deployed is limited to 100 due to logistical constraints. To achieve strategic objectives, the combined strength of two units of X and one unit of Y must be at least 50. Also, the combined strength of one unit each from X and Z must be at least 40. Each unit in X, Y, and Z requires \$5000, \$4000, and \$6000 respectively for their operations.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers due to practicalities (as you cannot have fractions of a military unit), what is the minimum total cost required for this operation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
