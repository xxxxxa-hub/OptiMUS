An agricultural manager is planning the distribution of farmland among three crops: wheat, corn, and soybeans. The goal is to minimize the total cost of cultivation while adhering to specific constraints. Each acre of land dedicated to wheat, corn, and soybean cultivation incurs costs of 5 units, 4 units, and 6 units respectively.\n\nThe following conditions must be met due to soil quality restrictions and market demand:\n- The combined acres for twice the amount of wheat plus corn cannot exceed 50.\n- The sum of the acres for wheat and thrice that for soybeans must not exceed 60.\n- The combined acres for corn and soybeans should be at least 30 to meet minimum market requirements.\n\nGiven these conditions with all measurements in whole numbers because an acre is a indivisible unit in this context:\nWhat would be the minimum total cost for cultivation under optimal distribution across these three crops? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
