A power company is planning to allocate resources between two types of energy production: $X$ and $Y$. Both productions have their own costs per unit, with cost for type $X$ being $\$50$ per unit and for type $Y$, it is $\$70$ per unit. The total units produced from both the types must be at least 5000 units to meet the energy demand. However, due to environmental regulations, the combined emission from these plants calculated as 10 times the units from type X plus 15 times the units from type Y should not exceed 80000. Given these constraints and assuming that the number of units produced are whole numbers due to practical limitations (X, Y are integers), what is the minimum possible cost in dollars of meeting this demand?
