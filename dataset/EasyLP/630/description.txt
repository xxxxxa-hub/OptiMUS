In a human resources scenario, a company needs to allocate resources across four different departments: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These could represent areas such as marketing, finance, research and development, and operations respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these departments, with costs being $\$500$, $\$600$, $\$800$, and $\$700$ per unit for $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limits and strategic considerations:\n- The combined resource allocation for departments $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 100 units.\n- Similarly, the combined resource allocation for departments $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 50 units.\n- The allocation for department $x3$ should be at least twice of that reduced from department $x1$, reflecting a shift in focus towards research and development.\n- The allocation for department $x4$ should be no less than three quarters of that reduced from department $x2$, possibly indicating an increased emphasis on operational efficiency.\n- Furthermore, the difference between allocations in departments ($x3 + x4)$ minus those in ($x1 + x2)$ should be at least 30 units , indicating an overall rebalancing of resources towards research/development (department X3)and operations (department X4).\n\nGiven these conditions along with specific bounds on each department's resource allocation. What is the minimum total cost for the company given optimal integer allocations within specified bounds rounded to nearest whole number?
