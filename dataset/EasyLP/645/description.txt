A military commander is planning to allocate resources between four types of units, X1, X2, X3 and X4. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the units. The total number of units that can be supported for X1 and X2 combined is limited to 200 due to logistical constraints. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined strength of twice the units of X1 and three and a half times the units of X3 must be at least 400. Additionally, the difference in units between X2 and half of those allocated to unit type X4 cannot exceed 50. Furthermore, after subtracting the number of units for both unit types X1 and unit type X3 from those for unit type x2, it should not exceed 70.\n\nEach unit requires different support points: Unit type x1 needs 10000 points, Unit type x2 needs 5000 points, Unit type x3 needs 8000 points while Unit type x4 requires 6000 points respectively.\n\nThe commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are within specific bounds: The allocation for each unit cannot exceed its maximum capacity (150 for x1 ,100 for x2 ,80 for x3 ,20 for x4). What's the minimum total support points required rounded off to nearest whole number?
