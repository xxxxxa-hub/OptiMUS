A transportation company is planning to distribute resources between two types of vehicles: type $X$ and type $Y$. The total number of vehicles that can be used cannot exceed 50 due to logistical constraints. To meet the transportation demand, the combined capacity of these vehicles, calculated as 3 times the capacity for vehicle type X plus 2 times the capacity for vehicle type Y, must be at least 100 units. Each unit of vehicle type X and Y requires 2 and 3 fuel units respectively, and the company aims to minimize the total fuel consumption while meeting all constraints and ensuring that the number of vehicles for both X and Y are integers. Calculate the minimum total fuel consumption required for this operation, rounded to the nearest whole number.
