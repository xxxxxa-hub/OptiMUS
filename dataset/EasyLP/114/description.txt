A tourism manager is planning to organize two types of tours: $X$ and $Y$. The total number of tours that can be arranged is limited to 500 due to resource constraints. To achieve a certain diversity objective, the combined frequency of 3 times tour X and 2 times tour Y must be at least 1000. Furthermore, the difference between the number of type X and type Y tours should not exceed 200 for balancing purposes. Each tour X requires an investment of $\$50$, while each tour Y needs an investment of $\$30$. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of both types of tours are integers. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this operation, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
