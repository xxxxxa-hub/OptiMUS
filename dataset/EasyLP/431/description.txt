A transportation company is planning to allocate its fleet of trucks between two delivery routes, route X and route Y. The total number of trucks that can be assigned to both routes combined is limited to 500 due to operational constraints. Route X requires a minimum of 100 trucks for efficient operations while route Y needs at least 200 trucks. Each truck assigned to route X and Y incurs an operational cost of $10 and $20 respectively, and the company aims to minimize the total operational cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of trucks allocated for both routes are integers. Calculate the minimum total operational cost required for this scenario in dollars, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
