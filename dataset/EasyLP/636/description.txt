A tourism department is planning to allocate resources to four different tourist attractions: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These could involve promoting local culture, natural beauty, historical sites, and adventure activities respectively. The objective is to minimize the total promotion cost associated with these attractions, with costs being $300, 200, 100,$ and $50$ units for $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and expected returns:\n- The combined resource allocation for promoting local culture ($x1$) and natural beauty ($x2$) cannot exceed 500 units.\n- The allocation for twice the promotion of local culture ($x1$) along with three-and-half times the promotion of historical sites ($x3$) must be at least 700 units to meet minimum visibility requirements.\n- The difference between resource allocated for natural beauty($x2$), half of that for historical sites($0.5*x3$), and local culture ($x1$) should not exceed 300 units ensuring balanced promotions.\n- The difference in resources allocated for adventure activities($0.5*x4$)and those allocated for natural beauty($x2$) must not exceed 400 units reflecting preferences of targeted tourists.\n- Resources allocated towards promoting adventure activities ($x4$) must be no more than those towards local culture minus 150 units as an operational policy.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function along with the requirement that the allocations for $x1,x2,x3,$ and $x4$ are whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources or facilities involved,\nWhat is the minimum total promotional cost required by tourism department given optimal allocation within specified bounds rounded off to nearest dollar?
