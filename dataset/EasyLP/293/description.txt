An educational institution is planning to offer three different courses: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total number of students who can enroll in courses X and Y combined cannot exceed 30 due to classroom capacity. Similarly, the total enrollment for courses Y and Z combined is capped at 20 due to faculty availability. To ensure a diverse range of offerings, the combined enrollment in courses X and Z should be at least 10. Each course has associated operational costs per student: Course $X$ costs 5 units, Course $Y$ costs 3 units, and Course $Z$ costs 1 unit. The institution aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. All values are integers due to the nature of student enrollment (you can't have half a student!). What is the minimum total cost for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number?
