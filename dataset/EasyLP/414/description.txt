A marketing firm is planning to distribute its budget between two advertising channels: X and Y. The total budget for both channels combined cannot exceed \$5000. Furthermore, the allocation of twice the budget to channel X over that allocated to channel Y should be at least \$1000, while the difference between the budget for channel X and thrice that for channel Y must not exceed \$2000. Each unit of effectiveness in advertising through channel X costs \$1000, while each unit through channel Y costs \$1500. The firm aims to minimize their total expenditure on these two channels while ensuring all allocations are integers due to billing constraints. What is the minimum possible expenditure in dollars, rounded off to the nearest dollar?
