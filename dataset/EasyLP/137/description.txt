In an environmental project, a team needs to allocate resources between two initiatives: X and Y, where the allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the resources. The total resource allocation for both initiatives combined is constrained by a maximum of 100 units. Additionally, to meet the project's objectives, the combined effort of these initiatives must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as 2 times the resources allocated to initiative X plus 3 times the resources allocated to initiative Y. Moreover, at least 30 units of resources need to be used in total across both initiatives. Given that each unit of resource for initiative $X$ costs $\$4$, and for initiative $Y$ costs $\$5$, and the team aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this project in dollars, rounded to nearest dollar.
