A real estate developer is planning to invest in three different types of properties: residential (x), commercial (y), and industrial (z). The investments need to be made in whole units due to the indivisible nature of properties. The total investment across all three property types cannot exceed 50 units because of budget constraints.\n\nThe developer needs to ensure that the combined investment, calculated as twice the investment in residential plus thrice the investment in commercial plus the investment in industrial, is at least 30 units, reflecting a balanced portfolio strategy. The difference between investments in residential and commercial should not be more than 10 units, indicating a cautious approach towards market risks. Moreover, the investment in commercial properties must always be at least 5 units more than that in industrial properties due to higher expected returns.\n\nEach unit of investment incurs costs which are $500 for residential properties, $700 for commercial properties and $900 for industrial properties. Considering these conditions, while respecting the individual upper limits on each type of property:\nWhat is the minimum total cost incurred by the developer given an optimal allocation among residential, commercial and industrial properties? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
