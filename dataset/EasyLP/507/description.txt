In an energy optimization scenario, a company needs to allocate resources across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total investment across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Each unit of investment in projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ yields different returns or costs, quantified as 20 , 30 , and 40 units, respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints:\n- The combined sum of the allocations for X, Y, and Z should not exceed 1000 units.\n- The difference between twice the allocation for X and that for Y combined with the allocation for Z must be at least 300 units.\n- The difference between the allocation for X and three times that of Y combined with negative times the allocation of Z should equal exactly 200 units.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of investment units due to funding practicalities (the bounds are given above), find out what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
