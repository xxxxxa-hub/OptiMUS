In a healthcare scenario, a hospital administrator is planning the allocation of resources between four departments: $X$ (General Medicine), $Y$ (Surgery), $Z$ (Pediatrics) and $W$ (Geriatrics). The total number of resources for each department are constrained due to budget limitations and patient needs. Each resource in the departments has different costs associated with it, quantified as $\$30$, $\$20$, $\$40$, and $\$50$, respectively. \n\nThe hospital has the following constraints on their resource allocation:- The combined resources of General Medicine (department $X$) and Surgery(department $Y$) must be at least 100 units to ensure adequate service levels.- Pediatrics(department $Z$) and Geriatrics(department $W$) can't have more than 200 units combined due to limited specialist staff availability.\n- Additionally, General Medicine(department X) together with Pediatrics(department Z) must have at least 150 units considering the high demand for these services.- Lastly, there should not be more than a difference of 50 units between Surgery (department Y) and Geriatrics (department W).\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of resources due to practicality reasons, what is the minimum total cost for the hospital given the optimal allocation of resources among the four departments? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
