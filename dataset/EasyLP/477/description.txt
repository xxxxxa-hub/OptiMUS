A tourism company needs to allocate resources between two types of services, X and Y. The total resources allocated cannot exceed 200 units due to budget constraints. To meet the company's strategic objectives, the combined effort of these services must yield a minimum performance score, calculated as 3 times the resources for service X plus 2 times the resources for service Y, of at least 400 points. Additionally, the difference in resources between service X and service Y must be at least 50 units to maintain a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource for service X is $500 and for service Y is $300. The company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (X, Y are integers). Given these conditions:\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this operation in dollars? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
