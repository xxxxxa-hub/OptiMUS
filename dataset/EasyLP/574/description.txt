A shipping company is planning to allocate its fleet of trucks across three different routes: Route X1, Route X2, and Route X3. The company aims to minimize the total operating cost associated with these routes, with costs being 4 units for each truck on Route X1, 5 units for each truck on Route X2, and 6 units for each truck on Route X3.\n\nThe allocation of trucks must adhere to the following constraints due to capacity limits and service requirements:\n- The combined number of trucks allocated to Route X1 and Route X2 cannot exceed 2000.\n- The sum of trucks assigned to Route X2 and Route X3 should be at least 1000 in order to meet demand.\n- The difference between the number of trucks assigned to route x1 and twice that for route x3 should exactly equal 500, reflecting specific route characteristics or strategic priorities.\n\nConsidering that the allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of trucks being indivisible entities, along with the fact that there are specific bounds on how many trucks can be assigned per route (1500 for x1, 1200 for x2 and 800 for x3):\nWhat is the minimum total operating cost for the company given these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole unit.
