A construction manager is planning the distribution of resources between two types of building projects, X and Y. Both types of projects must be completed in whole numbers due to their nature. The total resource allocation for both project types combined cannot exceed 60 units, with each unit representing a certain amount of man-hours, materials, or equipment usage. Specifically, every project X requires 2 units of resources and every project Y requires 3 units. The company has a minimum output requirement: the total number of projects (X and Y) completed must be at least 10.\n\nEach type of project also carries different costs: completing one project X costs $1000 while completing one project Y costs $500. The construction manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum possible total cost (in dollars) that allows the company to meet its output requirements and stay within resource limits? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
