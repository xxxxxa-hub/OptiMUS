A farmer has four fields where he can grow wheat, corn, soybeans and potatoes. Each field can only grow one type of crop and the crops must be grown in whole numbers of acres due to the nature of agricultural production. The farmer wants to minimize the total cost of planting these crops, where the cost per acre is \$2 for wheat, \$3 for corn, \$1 for soybeans, and \$4 for potatoes.\n\nThe following constraints apply due to various factors such as soil conditions, climate, market demand and storage capacity:- The combined area planted with wheat and corn must be at least 1000 acres.- The combined area planted with soybeans and potatoes cannot exceed 800 acres.- The area planted with wheat must exceed that of soybeans by at least 200 acres.- The combined area planted with corn and potatoes cannot exceed 500 acres.\n\nGiven these conditions (Wheat, Corn , Soybean , Potatoes are integers), what is the minimum total cost in dollars for planting these crops across all four fields?
