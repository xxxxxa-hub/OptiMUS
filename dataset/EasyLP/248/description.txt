A company needs to schedule shifts for three types of workers: type X, Y, and Z. The total number of shifts across all types cannot exceed 24 in a day due to operational constraints. Each shift of worker type X, Y, and Z costs the company 8, 6, and 10 units respectively.\n\nThe following conditions must also be met:\n- The number of shifts for worker type X should be at least 2 more than those for worker type Y due to skill requirements.\n- The difference between the number of shifts for worker types Y and Z should not exceed 4 to maintain a balanced workforce.\n\nFurthermore, there are limits on how many shifts each type of worker can cover in a day: Worker type X can cover up to 12 shifts; Worker type Y can cover up to 8 shifts; Worker type Z can cover up to 6 shifts.\n\nGiven that the company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these conditions (and bearing in mind that the number of shifts has to be whole numbers), what is the minimum total cost? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest unit.
