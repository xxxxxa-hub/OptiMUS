A school district is planning the allocation of teachers among four schools: X, Y, Z and W. The goal is to minimize the total cost associated with these allocations, where each teacher at school X costs 2 units, at school Y costs 3 units, at school Z costs 4 units and at school W costs 5 units.\n\nThe distribution must adhere to the following constraints due to teacher availability and individual school requirements:- The combined number of teachers for X and Y minus surplus (s1) must be exactly 50.- The combined number of teachers for Y and Z minus surplus (s2) must be exactly 100.- The number of teachers in Z minus those in W plus a surplus (s3) should be exactly equal to 20.- The number of teachers in X minus those in W plus a surplus (s4) should be exactly equal to 30.\n\nAll numbers including surpluses are integers due to the indivisible nature of human resources. Given these conditions:What is the minimum total cost for the district when optimally allocating teachers among the four schools within their respective bounds?
