An education department is planning to allocate resources between two programs, $X$ and $Y$. Each unit of resource allocated towards program $X$ yields a benefit score of 4, while each unit towards program $Y$ yields a benefit score of 3. The objective is to minimize the total benefit score under the following constraints: \n\n- The combined effort from twice the resources allocated to program $X$ and those allocated to program $Y$ must be at least 10 units. This reflects a minimum requirement for overall educational impact.\n- The sum of the resources allocated to program $X$ and three times those allocated to program $Y$ cannot exceed 30 units due to budgetary constraints.\n\nGiven that the allocations for both programs must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of these resources:\nWhat is the minimum total benefit score achievable under these conditions, rounded to the nearest whole number?
