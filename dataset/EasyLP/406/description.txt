A shipping company is planning the allocation of cargo across four vessels: $X, Y, Z$, and $W$. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these allocations, with costs being $10, 15, 20,$ and $25$ per unit for vessels $X, Y, Z$, and $W$ respectively. \n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to vessel capacities and shipment requirements:\n- The combined cargo allocation for vessels $X$ and $Y$ cannot exceed 500 units.\n- The combined cargo allocation for vessels $Z$ and $W$ cannot exceed 700 units.\n- To balance the load across different types of vessels, the sum of allocations for vessels $X$ and $Z$ should be at least 200 units.\n- Similarly, the sum of allocations for vessels $Y$ and $W$ should be at least 300 units.\n\nGiven that all allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the cargos:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars for the company given an optimal allocation of cargos to these four vessels (rounded to nearest dollar)?
