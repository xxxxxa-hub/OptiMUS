A manufacturing company produces products using three main materials: steel, wood, and plastic. The costs associated with each unit of these materials are $10 for steel, $15 for wood, and $20 for plastic. Due to certain production requirements and constraints on material availability, the following conditions must be met:\n\n- The quantity of twice the steel plus wood should be at least 1000 units.\n- The combined quantity of steel and plastic cannot exceed 2000 units.\n- The difference in quantities between wood and plastic should be no less than 500 units.\n- The total quantity across all three materials must equal exactly 3500 units.\n\nMoreover, the quantities of steel, wood, and plastic used need to be whole numbers due to the nature of these resources. Given these parameters:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars that can be achieved while adhering to all constraints? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
