A farmer has three types of crops to plant: crop $X$, crop $Y$, and crop $Z$. Due to land limitations, the total number of acres that can be planted cannot exceed 1000. Based on the soil quality and climatic conditions, at least 200 acres should be allocated for crop $X$, at least 150 acres for crop $Y$ and at least 100 acres for crop $Z$. The cost per acre of planting for crops X, Y, and Z are \$10, \$20, and \$30 respectively. Given these constraints and considering that only whole numbers of acres can be planted due to practical reasons, find the minimum cost (in dollars) required to plant these crops while adhering to all these requirements. Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
