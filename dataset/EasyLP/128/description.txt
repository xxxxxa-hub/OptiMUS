In an environmental protection initiative, a non-profit organization is planning to undertake two projects: Project $X$ involves planting trees and Project $Y$ focuses on cleaning rivers. The cost per unit of project $X$ is $\$20$, and for project $Y$, it is $\$30$. To meet their objectives, the combined effort of these projects must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as 3 times the units of project X plus the units of project Y, of at least 10 points. However, due to budget constraints and manpower availability, the sum of units for project X and five times that of project Y cannot exceed 50.\n\nGiven that all efforts are measured in whole numbers (as it doesn't make sense to have partial efforts), what would be the minimum total cost required to achieve their goals while meeting all the constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
