A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: Project X1, Project X2, Project X3, and Project X4. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, improving data security, and implementing new technologies, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$50 per unit for project X1, \$30 per unit for project X2, \$70 per unit for project X3 and \$60 per unit for project X4.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for Projects X1 and X2 cannot exceed 2000 units.\n- Similarly, the combined resource allocation for Projects X3 and X4 cannot surpass 1500 units.\n- To maintain a balance in the upgrades and expansions across all regions served by the company half of the resources allocated to Project x1 should exceed by at least 500 units than one-third of resources allocated to project x2.\n- Also considering strategic importance there should be at least 100 more units allocated to Project x4 than that of x3.\n\nEach project has specific bounds on resource allocation: up-to 1000 units can be allocated to Project x1; up-to 1200 units can be assigned towards project x2; no more than 800 units should go towards funding of project x3; while maximum of 700 units can be dedicated towards implementation of newer technologies under project x4. \nThe allocations are required in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of certain resources involved.\nWhat would be the minimum total cost that this company will need to bear when optimally allocating its resources within specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded off nearest dollar.
