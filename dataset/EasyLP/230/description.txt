A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: X, Y, and Z. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, and implementing new technologies respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$10 per unit for project X, \$20 per unit for project Y, and \$30 per unit for project Z.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for all three projects cannot exceed 10000 units.\n- The sum of twice the allocation for project X plus thrice the allocation for project Y and the allocation for project Z must be at least 5000 units in order to meet specific requirements.\n- For balanced resource distribution, the difference between allocations of projects X and Y plus the allocation of project Z should not exceed 3000 units.\n\nGiven that all allocations must be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars (rounded to nearest dollar) that can be achieved by optimally allocating resources across these three projects?
