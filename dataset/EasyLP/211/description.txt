A healthcare manager is planning the distribution of resources among three departments: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different medical specialties or operational units within a hospital. The total resources available are limited to 100 units due to budget constraints. Department $X$ requires at least 10 more units than half the resources allocated to department $Y$, reflecting its high resource needs. The combined allocation for departments $Y$ and $Z$ cannot exceed 60 units, possibly due to limitations in infrastructure or staff availability. Each unit of resource allocated costs differently for each department: 5 for department X, 3 for department Y, and 7 for department Z.\n\nThe healthcare manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are integers (since fractional allocations are not practical in this context). What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number?
