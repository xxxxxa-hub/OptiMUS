An education department is planning to allocate funds across three programs: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These programs could represent different educational initiatives such as improving infrastructure, enhancing teacher training, or implementing new curriculum. The total funding across all three programs cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Program $X$ requires a minimum funding of 300 units to be operational, while program $Y$ needs at least 200 units. Program $Z$, on the other hand, requires a minimum funding of 100 units. Each unit of funding in programs $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as 500 , 300 , and 200 units respectively. The department aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to the funding constraints for each program and ensuring that all fundings are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number.
