A military base needs to allocate resources between four different units: $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ and $X_4$. These could represent different types of training, equipment or supplies. The total allocation for unit $X_1$ and unit $X_2$ combined cannot exceed 1000 due to logistical constraints. Also, the combined strength of twice the allocation for unit $X_1$ and the allocation for unit $X_3$ must be at least 800 to meet strategic objectives. The total allocation for unit $X_2$ and three times the allocation for unit $X_4$ cannot exceed 600 due to resource limitations. Furthermore, the difference in allocations between unit $X_1$ and half of that for unit $X_4$ should be at least 200.\n\nThe costs associated with each resource are as follows: each resource allocated to units X1, X2, X3, and X4 cost 2, 3, 4, and 5 units respectively. Given these conditions, and considering that all allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of resources being allocated (each project has specific bounds on resource allocation), what is the minimum total cost required given these constraints? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
