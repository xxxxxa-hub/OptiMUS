A shipping company is planning to allocate cargo among three different ships: X, Y, and Z. Each ship has a different cost per unit of cargo, with costs being $5 for ship X, $7 for ship Y, and $3 for ship Z. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to the following constraints due to capacity and regulatory limitations:- The combined cargo carried by twice the amount on ship X, thrice the amount on ship Y and the amount on ship Z must be at least 30 units.- The total cargo carried by ships X, four times that of Y and twice that of Z cannot exceed 50 units.- The difference in cargo between ships X and Y along with the amount on Z should be at least 10 units.The allocations for each ship must be whole numbers due to logistical practicalities. Also there are bounds on each allocation: Ship X can carry up to 100 units of cargo; Ship Y can carry up to 80 units; Ship Z can carry up to 60 units.What is the minimum total cost for the company given these constraints? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
