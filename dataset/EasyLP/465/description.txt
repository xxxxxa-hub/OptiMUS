A human resources manager is planning to allocate the working hours between two teams, Team X and Team Y, for an upcoming project. The minimum number of hours that can be allocated to Team X is 10 and for Team Y is 5. The total working hours for both teams combined cannot exceed 40 due to budget constraints. Given that the cost per hour for Team X is $50 and for Team Y is $80, and the HR manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints (assuming that only whole numbers of hours can be allocated). What will be the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
