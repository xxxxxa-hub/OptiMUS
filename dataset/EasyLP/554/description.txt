In a Human Resources scenario, a company is planning to allocate its workforce among three different departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total number of employees that can be allocated across all three departments cannot exceed 100 due to budget constraints. Department $X$ requires at least 20 employees, Department $Y$ needs at least 30 employees, and Department $Z$ needs at least 10 employees for operational efficiency. The associated costs per employee for Departments $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are $\$5000$, $\$4000$, and $\$6000$ respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints (with the number of employees in each department being an integer). What is the minimum total cost for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar?
