In a human resources scenario, a manager is trying to allocate the department's budget across two projects: Project $X$ and Project $Y$. These projects could represent investments in employee training programs or benefits packages. The total budget across both projects cannot exceed 100 units due to fiscal constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum investment of 30 units to be viable, while project $Y$ requires at least 20 units. Each unit of investment in Projects $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of 50 and 60 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the project constraints and ensuring that all investments are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of financial resources. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number?
