A farmer has a field of 100 acres on which he can grow wheat and corn. The farmer needs to decide how many acres to dedicate to each crop in order to maximize his profits. Each acre of wheat yields a profit of $20, while each acre of corn yields a profit of $30. However, due to market demands and farming regulations, the combined output from 3 acres of wheat and 2 acres of corn must be at least 200 units (a unit represents the yield from an acre). Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of acres due to practicalities, what is the maximum total profit that the farmer can make by optimally allocating his land between wheat and corn? Provide your answer in dollars, rounded to the nearest whole number.
