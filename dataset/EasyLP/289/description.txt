In an educational institution, there is a need to allocate time for three activities: X represents academic lessons, Y represents extracurricular activities, and Z represents student counseling sessions. The objective is to optimize the use of institutional resources by minimizing the total effort score associated with these activities. The effort scores per hour are 5 for activity X, 4 for activity Y, and 3 for activity Z.\n\nThe following constraints apply to the allocation of time:- The combined hours of academic lessons (X) and extracurricular activities (Y) cannot exceed 100 due to scheduling limitations.- To ensure a balanced program, the sum of hours for academic lessons (X) and student counseling sessions (Z) must be at least 50.- Furthermore, the difference in hours between extracurricular activities (Y) and student counseling sessions (Z) must not exceed 20 to maintain a balance between these two important aspects of student development.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that allocations should be in whole numbers due to scheduling practicalities,What is the minimum total effort score given optimal allocation of hours among the three activities(X,Y,Z)? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
