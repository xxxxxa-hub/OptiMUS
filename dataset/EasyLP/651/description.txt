A real estate company is planning to invest in four different types of properties: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These could represent residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational properties respectively. The objective is to minimize the total investment cost while adhering to various constraints due to budget limits, market conditions, and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe costs associated with each unit of investment in these property types are $\$500$, $\$300$, $\$200$, and $\$100$ for $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$ respectively. \n\nThe constraints on the investments are as follows:\n- The combined number of units invested in residential and commercial properties ($x1$ and $x2$) cannot exceed 50.\n- Similarly, the combined number of units invested in industrial and recreational properties ($x3$ and $x4$) cannot exceed 70.\n- The net return on investment (ROI), calculated as half the units of residential property minus a quarter of the units of commercial property plus 15% of the units of industrial property plus the units of recreational property, must be at least 20.\n- To ensure diversified portfolio risk management, the difference between two-and-a-half times the units invested in commercial properties plus three-quarters of those invested in industrial properties minus those invested in both residential and recreational properties should not exceed 30.\n\nGiven that all investments have to be integers due to real-world considerations like zoning laws or minimum size requirements for certain types of projects:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this real estate investment strategy within these specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
