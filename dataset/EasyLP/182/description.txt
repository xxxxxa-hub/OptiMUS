An energy company is planning to allocate resources among three different projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different types of renewable energy sources. The total resources available for all the three projects combined cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. Additionally, the resource allocation needs to satisfy two more conditions:- The amount of resources allocated to project $X$ should be at least twice that of project $Y$.- Project $Z$ requires at least 10 more units of resources than project $X$. The cost associated with each unit of resource varies across the projects - it is $\$10$ for project $X$, $\$20$ for project $Y$, and $\$30$ for project $Z$. The objective is to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Considering that all allocations must be integers due to the indivisible nature of resources, what is the minimum total cost (in dollars) required under this scenario? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.
