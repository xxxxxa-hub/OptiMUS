An environmental organization is planning to allocate resources across three different projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These projects could involve forest conservation, pollution control, and renewable energy initiatives respectively. The total resources allocated to all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. The organization also has specific requirements for each project:\n\n- Project $X$ requires at least 200 more units than project $Y$.\n- The difference in the number of units between project $Z$ and project $X$ should not exceed 300 units.\n- The combined allocation for projects $Y$ and $Z$ must be at least 500 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to projects X, Y, and Z yields different impacts on the environment, quantified as 2 , 3 , and 4 impact points respectively. The organization aims to minimize the total impact points while adhering to these resource allocation constraints for each project (with allocations being whole numbers).\n\nCalculate the minimum total impact points required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number.
