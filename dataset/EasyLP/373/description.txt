A supply chain manager needs to allocate resources across four different warehouses: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These could represent inventories of different types of goods or supplies. The cost per unit resource for warehouses $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$ are 10, 15, 20, and 25 units respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost of resource allocation.\n\nThe allocation must meet the following constraints due to capacity limitations and demand requirements:- The combined resources for warehouse $x1$ and warehouse $x2$ cannot exceed 500 units.- Similarly, the combined resources for warehouse $x3$ and warehouse $x4$ cannot exceed 400 units.- To meet minimum demand requirements, the total resources in warehouse $x1$ and warehouse $x3$ must be at least 350 units.- Likewise, the total resources in warehouse $x2$ and warehouse $x4$ must be at least 300 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with each individual constraint on maximum resource allocation for each warehouse (i.e., no more than 500 units for both warehouses X1 & X2; no more than 400 units for both warehouses X3 & X4), as well as that all allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the goods:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost needed for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
