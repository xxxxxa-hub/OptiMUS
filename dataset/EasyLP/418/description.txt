An energy company is planning to allocate resources between two power plants, X and Y. The resource allocation is measured in units and can only be in whole numbers due to the nature of the resources. For each unit of resource allocated, plant X produces 60 units of power while plant Y produces 90 units.\n\nThe company has certain constraints for this allocation:\n- The combined resource allocation for twice that of plant X and thrice that of plant Y cannot exceed 1200 units.\n- The resource allocation for plant X must not be less than that for plant Y.\n- Additionally, the total resource allocations for both plants must at least amount to 100 units.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total power production possible by optimally allocating resources between the two plants? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
