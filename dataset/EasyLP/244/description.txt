A construction company is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These could represent building different types of structures. The total resource allocation across all three projects cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. To achieve a certain construction standard, the combined efforts of 2 units from project $X$ and 3 units from project $Y$ must be at least 50 units. Additionally, the difference in resource allocation between project $X$ and project $Z$ should not exceed 20 units for maintaining a balanced portfolio.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs of $\$5000$, $\$4000$, and $\$3000$ respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar.
