A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: X1, X2, and X3. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, and implementing new technologies, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being $10 per unit for project X1, $15 per unit for project X2, and $20 per unit for project X3.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The combined effort of 5 units from project X1 plus 7 units from project X2 along with 9 units from project X3 should at least meet a minimum effectiveness score of 5000 points.\n- The difference between thrice the allocation for Project X2 and that for Project X1 reduced by four times that of Project X3 must not exceed 1500 units.\n- The difference between the allocations for Projects X1 and X3 after reducing twice and a half of the allocation for Project x2 should exactly match 2000 units.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that all allocations are in whole numbers due to contractual obligations or physical resource limitations (e.g., man-hours), what is the minimum total cost rounded to nearest dollar? Each project has specific bounds on resource allocation: \nx1 can vary from 0 up to a maximum limit of 10000,\nx2 has an upper limit of 8000,\nand x3 can range up till a maximum of 6000.
