A logistics manager is planning the transportation of goods using two types of vehicles: type X and type Y. The total number of vehicles used must be at least 10 to meet demand. Additionally, due to road capacity and scheduling constraints, the combined usage of 2 units of vehicle X and 3 units of vehicle Y cannot exceed 25. Each vehicle type has a different cost associated with its operation: each unit of vehicle X costs $5, while each unit of vehicle Y costs $7. To keep costs down, the logistics manager wants to minimize the total cost while meeting all transportation requirements, assuming that only whole numbers of vehicles can be used due to the indivisible nature of a vehicle.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars for this operation? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
