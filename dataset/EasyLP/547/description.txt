A supply chain manager is planning the allocation of resources across three different sectors: manufacturing (x1), distribution (x2), and retail (x3). The objective is to minimize the total operational cost associated with these sectors, which are 2, 3, and 4 units for x1, x2, and x3 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and operational requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for manufacturing, distribution and retail cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The allocation for five times manufacturing minus half of that allocated to distribution must be at least 500 units. This might reflect a higher demand in production or a specific strategy of the company.\n- The difference between four and a half times the retail sector's resources and those allocated to manufacturing should not exceed 450 units. This could be due to balance in operations or market demands.\n- Furthermore, the sum of resources allocated to distribution and half of those dedicated to retail minus those devoted to manufacturing should be at least 200 units. This could represent some necessary conditions imposed by logistical issues or business strategies.\n\nGiven these conditions and taking into account that each sector has specific bounds on resource allocation because real-world resources are indivisible thus must be whole numbers: The allocation for manufacturing should be less than 600, for distribution shoule be at most 500, for retail should be less than 300 \nWhat would be the minimum total operational cost for this supply chain scenario if we optimally allocate our resources within their specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest dollar.
