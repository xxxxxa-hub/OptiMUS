A military logistics commander needs to allocate resources between two divisions, X and Y. The total resources available for both divisions combined cannot exceed 10,000 units due to logistical constraints. To achieve strategic objectives, the sum of twice the resources allocated to division X and those allocated to division Y must be at least 6,000 units. Additionally, the difference in resource allocation between division X and division Y should not exceed 2,000 units to ensure balanced operation. Each unit of resource allocated costs $5,000 for division X and $3,000 for division Y. Given these conditions and considering that the allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the resources being allocated (e.g., personnel or equipment which cannot be split), what is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this operation? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
