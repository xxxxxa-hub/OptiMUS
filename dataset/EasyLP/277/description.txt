A sports coach is planning the weekly training schedule for three different types of training: strength (X), endurance (Y), and agility (Z). The fatigue levels associated with each hour of training are 6, 3, and 5 respectively. The coach has the following constraints on the training hours:- The combined hours of strength and endurance must be at least 8 to meet basic fitness requirements.- The sum of strength and agility cannot exceed 10 hours to avoid overexertion.- The difference between endurance and agility should be at least 2 hours to maintain a balanced program.\n\nAll training sessions have to be whole numbers due to scheduling practicalities. Given these conditions, what is the minimum total fatigue level for the team, given the optimal allocation of weekly training hours among strength, endurance, and agility? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
