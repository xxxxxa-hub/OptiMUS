In a military strategy scenario, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units: X and Y. These units could represent different troop categories or weapons systems, and the allocations must be in whole numbers due to the nature of the units. The total number of units that can be supported is limited to 10000 due to logistical constraints.\n\nThe strategic objectives impose certain requirements on the allocation of these resources:\n- The sum of unit X and unit Y cannot exceed 10000, reflecting available manpower or budget limits.\n- The combined strength represented by twice unit X plus unit Y must be at least 7000, showing minimum force requirements for achieving mission goals.\n- The difference between the number of unit X and twice the number of unit Y cannot exceed 2000, ensuring a balanced force composition.\n\nEach unit of X requires 5000 support points and each unit of Y requires 3000 support points. Given these conditions, what is the minimum total support points required for this operation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
