A tourism agency is planning to organize two types of trips, X and Y. The number of each type of trip must be a whole number due to the nature of these trips. The total number of trips that can be organized is limited to 50 due to resource constraints. To achieve a balance in offerings, the combined count of 2 times the number of trip X and 3 times the number of trip Y must be at least 30. Each trip X and Y requires an investment cost of \$100 and \$200 respectively, and the agency aims to minimize the total investment while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total investment required for this operation, rounded to the nearest dollar.
