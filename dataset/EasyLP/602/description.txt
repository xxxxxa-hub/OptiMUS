A retail store manager is planning the allocation of resources across four departments: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These could represent different product categories such as electronics, clothing, groceries, and home decor. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost associated with these departments, with costs being 2, 3, 4, and 5 units for $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic considerations:\n- The combined resource allocation for departments $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The sum of twice the allocation for department $x1$ and thrice that for department $x2$ should be at least 500 units to ensure minimum service levels.\n- The resource allocation difference between department $x3$ and department $x1$ should not exceed 200 units to maintain balanced offerings.\n- The resource allocation in department $x4$ should be at least 150 units more than that in department $x2$, possibly due to higher demand or strategic importance.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that allocations for all departments must be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources (units), what is the minimum total operating cost for managing all four departments within their respective bounds? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
