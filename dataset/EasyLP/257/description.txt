A supply chain manager is planning the allocation of resources across three different locations: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These could represent warehouses or distribution centers in a logistics network. The total available resources cannot exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints. To meet customer demand, at least 2000 units must be allocated to location X and Y combined with twice the allocation for location X than Y. Additionally, the combined resources allocated to location Y and Z cannot exceed 2500 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocation costs differently at each location due to variations in operational costs, wages, taxes, etc. The cost per unit of resource is 50 for location X, 30 for location Y and 20 for location Z. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Given that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario rounded off to the nearest whole number?
