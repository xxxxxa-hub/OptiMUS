The human resources department of a company needs to allocate employees across three different projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. Each employee can only be assigned to one project. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being $\$5000$ for each employee on project $X$, $\$4000$ for each employee on project $Y$, and $\$6000$ for each employee on project $Z$. The total number of employees available is 20.\n\nThere are also minimum staff requirements for each project due to their complexity and scope:- Project $X$ requires at least 5 employees.- Project $Y$ requires at least 3 employees.- Project $Z$ requires at least 2 employees.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that the number of employees allocated must be an integer (as we cannot split an employee), what is the minimum total cost for the HR department, given the optimal allocation of employees to the three projects? Provide your answer in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar.
