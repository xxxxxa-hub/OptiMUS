In a supply chain management scenario, a company needs to allocate resources between two facilities: $X$ and $Y$. The total allocation for both facilities combined cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. To maintain operational efficiency, the company has set forth some additional requirements:\n\n- Three times the allocation for facility $X$ minus twice that of facility $Y$ should be at least zero.\n- The difference in allocation between facility $X$ and facility $Y$ should be at least 200 units, ensuring balanced resource distribution across both facilities.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to facilities $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of 50 and 30 units respectively. Given these conditions, the company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints (The allocations for X and Y must be integers).\n\nMoreover, due to certain limitations, the maximum amount of resources that can be allocated to facility X is 700 units and to facility Y is 500 units.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost incurred by this optimal resource allocation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
