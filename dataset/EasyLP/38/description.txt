In a financial planning scenario, an investment manager needs to allocate funds between two investment options: X and Y. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the investments. The total amount invested in both options combined cannot exceed $100,000 due to budget constraints. Investment X requires a minimum investment of $10,000 to be viable, while for investment Y, it cannot be less than $5,000. To achieve a certain risk-return balance in the portfolio, the sum of three times the investment in option X minus the investment in option Y must be at least $20,000. Each dollar invested in options X and Y yields different returns or costs, quantified as $5000 and $4000 respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario rounded to nearest hundred dollars.
