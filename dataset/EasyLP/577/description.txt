A shipping company needs to allocate its fleet of trucks across three routes: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The allocation should be in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the trucks. The total number of trucks assigned to routes $X$ and $Y$ combined cannot exceed 200 due to limited availability of vehicles. To ensure sufficient coverage, the sum of trucks on routes $Y$ and $Z$ must be at least 150. Additionally, there are specific operational requirements such that the difference between the number of trucks on route $X$ and route $Z$ is exactly 30.\n\nThe cost per truck varies for each route: it's \$5 for route X, \$4 for route Y, and \$3 for route Z. The company aims to minimize total costs while adhering to these constraints within the bounds of truck allocations: no more than 100 trucks can be assigned to Route X, no more than 120 to Route Y, and no more than 90 to Route Z.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required given this scenario in dollars, rounded off to nearest dollar.
