An environmental organization is planning three different projects: $X1, X2$, and $X3$. These projects could involve reforestation, pollution cleanup, and community education respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects. Costs per unit are 4 units for project $X1$, 5 units for project $X2$ and 6 units for project $X3$.\n\nThe allocation of resources must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary, manpower, and feasibility considerations:\n- The combined resource allocation for project $X1$ along with twice that of project $X2$ should not exceed 1000 units.\n- The sum of resources allocated to project $X2$ and thrice those allocated to project $X3$ should be at least 600 units. This may reflect a minimum requirement for certain key initiatives within these projects.\n- Additionally, the difference between twice the resources allocated to project $X3$ and those assigned to project $X1$ must be exactly 500 units. This could represent a strategic balance in focus between different types of initiatives.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that all resource allocations must be whole numbers due to practical realities (such as person-hours or full equipment pieces), what is the minimum total cost in terms of resource allocation required for these projects within their specific bounds? Round your answer off to the nearest whole number.
