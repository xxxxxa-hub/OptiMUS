A supply chain manager needs to allocate resources across three divisions: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different stages in the supply chain like manufacturing, storage, and distribution. The total allocation across all three divisions cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Division $X$ requires at least 200 more units than division $Y$ to be viable while division $Z$ must have at least 50 more units than division $Y$, possibly due to higher operational costs or larger scale.\n\nEach unit of allocation for divisions $X, Y$, and $Z$ has associated costs of 4, 5, and 6 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are integers due to the indivisible nature of resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario given these conditions? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
