A military general needs to allocate resources among three types of units: X, Y, and Z. The total number of units that can be allocated cannot exceed 150 due to logistical constraints. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined strength of 3 units of X and 4 units of Y must be at least 100. Additionally, the difference in numbers between unit Z and unit X should not exceed 30 to ensure balanced power distribution. Moreover, there should always be at least 20 more units in Y than in Z.\n\nEach unit of X requires $10,000 support points while each unit of Y and Z require $2,000 and $500 support points respectively. The goal is to minimize the total support points needed while meeting all these constraints (X,Y,Z are integers).\n\nWhat is the minimum total number of support points required for this operation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
