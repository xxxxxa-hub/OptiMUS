An environmental agency is planning to reduce the emissions of two types of greenhouse gases: CO2 and Methane. The agency aims to minimize the total cost associated with these emission reductions, with costs being 4 units for each unit reduction in CO2 emissions and 3 units for each unit reduction in Methane emissions. \n\nThe agency has set certain constraints based on technological capabilities, budget limitations, and environmental targets:\n- The combined reduction in CO2 and Methane emissions cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The difference between twice the reduction in CO2 emissions and the reduction in Methane must be at least 200 units, reflecting specific environmental priorities.\n- Furthermore, half the reduction in CO2 plus the reduction in Methane should equal exactly 400 units, indicating a balanced approach towards managing both types of emissions.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that emission reductions can only be achieved in whole numbers due to practical implementation reasons: What is the minimum total cost for the agency to meet its emission reduction targets? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
