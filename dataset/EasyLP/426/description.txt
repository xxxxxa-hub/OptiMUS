A manufacturing company is planning to produce two types of products: $X$ and $Y$. The production costs per unit for product $X$ and product $Y$ are $\$50$ and $\$75$, respectively. Due to capacity constraints, the combined number of units for both products cannot exceed 1200. Furthermore, the company aims to maintain a minimum gap of 300 units between the number of units produced for product $X$ and product $Y$, with more units being produced for product X. Also, twice the quantity of product X plus the quantity of product Y should not surpass 2000 units due to storage limitations. Given that production quantities must be whole numbers due to their physical nature, find the minimum total production cost in dollars while adhering to these constraints, rounded to the nearest dollar.
