An environmental management agency is planning to allocate resources across four projects: $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ and $X4$. These projects could represent different environmental initiatives such as reforestation, pollution control, wildlife conservation, and sustainable infrastructure development. Each project requires a certain amount of funding with costs being 2, 3, 4 and 5 units for $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ and $X4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following conditions due to budgetary constraints and specific project requirements:\n- The difference between twice the allocation for project X2 and the allocations for projects X1 and X3 added to the allocation for project X4 must be at least 1000 units.\n- The combined allocation for projects X1 and X3 cannot exceed half of that allocated to project X2 plus 70% of that allocated to project X4 by more than 500 units.\n- The sum of 80% of the allocation for project X1, all of that for project X3 but subtracting from it about 90% of that allocated to project X2 should not exceed 1500 units.\n- The total resource distribution across all four projects should be no less than 200 units.\n- Additionally, the difference between about three-fifths of the resources given to Project x2 from those given to Projects x1 and x3 cannot exceed 300 units.\n\nAll allocations are made in whole numbers due to accounting procedures. Moreover, each individual initiative has its specific bounds on resource allocation: \nThe resources assigned to initiatives $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ &amp; &amp; shall not be less than \$100,\$50,\$20 &amp; \$40 respectively while their maximum limits have been set at \$800,\$600,\$400 &amp; \$200 respectively.\n\nGiven these conditions and the objective function, what is the minimum total cost for the agency, given the optimal allocation of resources to the four projects within their specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
