A construction company is planning to allocate resources for a new project. The resources include labor, material, and equipment. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these resources, with costs being 5 units per labor hour, 3 units per unit of material, and 2 units per unit of equipment.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and project requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for four times labor hours and material cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The combined strength of twice the labor hours and three times the equipment should be at least 500 units.\n- The difference between the allocations for material and equipment must be exactly 100 units.\n\nGiven these conditions and taking into account that all allocations are in whole numbers due to practical considerations,\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this construction project given an optimal allocation of resources? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
