A company's human resources department needs to allocate its annual training budget across three departments: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These departments could represent different functional areas such as sales, marketing, and engineering. The total budget for all three departments cannot exceed \$100,000 due to the overall financial constraints of the company. Department $X$ requires a minimum budget of \$30,000 to conduct essential training programs. Similarly, department $Y$ needs at least \$20,000 while department $Z$ requires a minimum of \$10,000.\n\nThe cost per employee trained in each department is different due to varying program requirements. For department $X$, it costs \$5,000 per employee; for department $Y$, it costs \$3,000; and for department $Z$, it costs \$2,000. The HR manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the budget constraints and ensuring that the budgets are allocated in multiples of thousand dollars due to the nature of contractual agreements with training providers.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible total cost (in dollars) required to meet these constraints? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
