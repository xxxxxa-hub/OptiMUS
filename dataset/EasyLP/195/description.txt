A transportation manager is planning the optimal allocation of vehicles across three routes: X, Y, and Z. Each route has different costs associated with it due to factors such as distance, tolls, and fuel consumption. The cost per vehicle for routes X, Y, and Z are 2, 3, and 4 units respectively.\n\nThe company has the following constraints for their daily operations:\n\n- The combined number of vehicles on routes X and Y cannot exceed 100 due to traffic congestion during peak hours.\n- Similarly, the combined number of vehicles on routes Y and Z is limited to a maximum of 150 due to restrictions on total fleet size.\n- To ensure adequate coverage across all regions served by the company, the sum of vehicles operating on routes X and Z must be at least 80.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that the allocation must be in whole numbers due to each vehicle being indivisible, what is the minimum total cost for running operations across all three routes (X,Y,Z), given an optimal allocation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole unit.
