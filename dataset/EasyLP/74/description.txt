A construction company is planning to build two types of buildings: type X and type Y. The cost per unit for building type X is $\$50$ and for building type Y is $\$70$. The company has the following constraints due to manpower, equipment, and time:- At least 100 units of total buildings need to be constructed, where each unit of building type X contributes 5 units towards this requirement, and each unit of building type Y contributes 10 units.- The total number of buildings that can be constructed (sum of X and Y) cannot exceed 20 due to limited resources.Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of buildings due to practicalities in construction, what is the minimum total cost required by the construction company for this project? Provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar.
