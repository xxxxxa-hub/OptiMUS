A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: Project 1, Project 2, Project 3, and Project 4. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, improving data security, and implementing new technologies respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects which are estimated at \$5 for each unit of resource in Project 1, \$7 for each unit of resource in Project 2, \$3 for each unit of resource in Project 3 and \$8 for each unit of resource in Project 4.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The total allocation between the resources assigned to Project 1 and twice that of project 2 cannot exceed a limit of 1500 units.\n- For meeting specific project requirements, thrice the amount allocated to project one along with those assigned to project three should be no less than a threshold value of a thousand units.\n- To ensure balance in distribution across various initiatives, quadruple the resources devoted towards project four when compared against those earmarked for project two must not surpass a maximum limit set at six hundred units.\n- There exists an inter-dependency constraint among all four projects where by summing up allocations towards Projects two through four after subtracting out those marked for project one should result in an overall deficit amounting to two hundred units.\n\nEach variable x1,x2,x3,x4 can only take integer values representing whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of certain types of resources. Also there are certain upper bounds on how much can be allocated towards individual projects as follows: x1<=500 ,x2<=400 ,x3<=300 ,x4<=200 \n\nGiven these conditions what is minimum total cost required rounded off to nearest dollar if company adheres strictly to above mentioned conditions while allocating resources across these four projects?
