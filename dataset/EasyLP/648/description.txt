A military logistics commander is planning the allocation of resources across four different units: $X1, X2, X3,$ and $X4$. These units could represent various aspects such as ammunition supply, personnel deployment, vehicle maintenance, and intelligence gathering respectively. The commander aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints. The costs associated with each unit are 5000, 3000, 4000, and 2000 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must follow these conditions due to operational requirements:\n- The total combined resource allocated for all four units should not exceed 10000.\n- Five times the resource allocated to unit $X1$ should be at least 2000 more than three-and-a-half times that allocated to unit $X2$.\n- Four-point-seven times the resource allocated to unit $X4$ should be no more than 3500 greater than that allocated to unit $X3$.\n- The sum of the resources allocated for units $X2$, three-and-a-half times those for unit $X3$, and those for unit $X4$, less two-and-a-half times those for unit $X1$, must be at least 1000.\n\nFurthermore, there are certain bounds on how much can be allocated to each individual unit due to specific practical limitations:\n$x1$: Between 0 and 3000,\n$x2$: Between 0 and 2500,\n$x3$: Between 0 and 1500,\n$x4$: Between 0 and 300.\nThe allocations must be in whole numbers due to the nature of military resources being indivisible. \nThe question is: What would be the minimum total cost rounded up to nearest dollar when optimal allocation is done following above constraints?
