A construction manager is planning the allocation of resources across three different projects: X, Y, and Z. These could represent different types of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, or buildings. The total resources that can be allocated to all three projects combined cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. Each project has specific requirements: the combined resource allocation for twice Project X and Project Y must be at least 30 units to ensure their viability; similarly, the sum of resources allocated to Projects X and Z must be at least 40 units.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource varies among projects: it's \$1000 for Project X, \$2000 for Project Y, and \$3000 for Project Z. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints.\n\nIn addition, due to practical limitations on manpower and materials availability, there are bounds on how much can be allocated to each project: between 0 (inclusive) and 50 (inclusive) units for Project X; between 0 (inclusive) and 60 (inclusive) units for Project Y; between 0 (inclusive) and 70 (inclusive) units for Project Z.\n\nGiven these conditions with all allocations being whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources, what is the minimum total cost required in dollars? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
