A transportation manager is in charge of allocating resources to three different routes, X, Y, and Z. The total resource allocation across all three routes cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. To maintain service quality, the allocation for twice the route X minus that for route Y must be at least 200 units. Furthermore, the difference in resources between route Y and Z must not exceed 50 units to ensure a balanced distribution.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource varies for each route: it's $10$ for route X, $20$ for route Y and $30$ for route Z. The objective of the manager is to minimize the total cost while meeting these constraints.\n\nGiven that the resource allocations are whole numbers due to operational requirements and considering specific bounds on resource allocation for each project:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars required under this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
