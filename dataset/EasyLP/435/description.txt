A financial manager is planning the allocation of funds between two investment options: option $X$ and option $Y$. The total investment in both options combined must be at least $\$ 80$, while the difference in investment between $X$ and $Y$ should not exceed $\$ 10$. Additionally, to maintain a balanced portfolio, the weighted difference between 60% of the investment in option X and 40% of that in option Y cannot surpass $\$50$. Given that the cost per unit return for option $X$ is $\$200$, and for option $Y$, it is $\$100$, how much would be the minimum total cost if all investments are made in whole numbers due to indivisibility of certain securities, rounded to the nearest dollar?
