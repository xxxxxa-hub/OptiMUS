A financial advisor is planning the allocation of investment funds between two types of assets: stocks and bonds. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these investments, with costs being \$5 per unit for stocks and \$3 per unit for bonds.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to client's risk tolerance and return requirements:- The combined investment in 2 units of stocks and 4 units of bonds must be at least \$10,000.- The investment in 3 units of stocks minus the investment in bonds must not exceed \$5000, reflecting a balance between risk and return.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of asset units due to their indivisible nature, what is the minimum total cost for the advisor given this optimal allocation strategy, rounded to the nearest dollar?
