An environmental agency is planning to implement three projects to improve the local environment: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The projects could involve forest restoration, pollution control, and wildlife protection, respectively. Each project has different costs associated with it, where each unit of investment in projects $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ cost 5 , 3 , and 2 units respectively. The agency aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to some constraints due to budgetary limitations and project requirements.\n\n- The combined resources allocated for project X and Y cannot exceed 20 units.- To meet certain objectives, the combined efforts of twice the resources allocated for project Y and the resources allocated for project Z must be at least 10 units.- Similarly, another objective requires that the combined resources for projects X and Z should not exceed 15 units.\n\nGiven these conditions, with all investments being whole numbers due to administrative regulations:What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
