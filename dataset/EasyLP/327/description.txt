A real estate developer is planning the construction of three types of properties: single-family homes (X), multi-family homes (Y), and commercial buildings (Z). The total number of properties that can be built is limited to 1000 due to regulatory constraints. For the community development plan, a minimum of 400 single-family homes, 250 multi-family homes, and 350 commercial buildings need to be constructed. Each type of property incurs different costs: each single-family home costs \$200k, each multi-family home costs \$300k, and each commercial building costs \$150k. The developer aims to minimize the total construction cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that the numbers for X, Y, Z are integers due to the nature of property units. Calculate the minimum total construction cost required for this scenario in dollars(k means thousand), rounded to nearest dollar.
