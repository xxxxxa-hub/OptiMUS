A shipping company needs to deliver packages using two types of vehicles: $X$ and $Y$. The total weight that can be shipped by all vehicles is limited to 40000 pounds. To meet demand, the combined number of vehicles must be at least 3000. Each vehicle type X and Y has a different capacity and costs \$10 and \$20 per vehicle respectively. If the company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints and ensuring that the number of both types of vehicles are integers, what is the minimum total cost in dollars?
