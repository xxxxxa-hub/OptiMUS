A telecommunications company is planning to allocate its bandwidth resources between two services, X and Y. The total bandwidth available for allocation to both services combined cannot exceed 10,000 units. To maintain a high level of service quality, the allocated bandwidth for service X must be at least half of that for service Y (i.e., $x - 0.5y \geq 3000$). Furthermore, to ensure balanced resource distribution, the difference in bandwidth allocation between services Y and X should not exceed three quarters of that for X (i.e., $y - 0.75x \leq 2000$). Each unit of bandwidth allocated to services X and Y incurs costs of \$20 and \$30 respectively, and the company aims to minimize these costs while ensuring all constraints are met.\n\nGiven these conditions and assuming that allocations must be in whole numbers due to practical considerations:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
