A retail store manager is planning to allocate the budget between two departments, X and Y. The total combined budget for both departments should not exceed $\$ 1000$. To maintain a minimum standard of operations, the combined effort of these departments must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as twice the budget for department X plus the budget for department Y, of at least 500 points. Furthermore, to avoid significant discrepancies in funding, the difference in budgets allocated to department X and department Y should not be more than $\$ 300$. Given that the cost per unit of effectiveness for department $X$ is $\$ 5$ and for department $Y$ is $\$ 3$, and the manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (and considering that budgets are allocated in whole dollar amounts), find the minimum total cost in dollars rounded to nearest dollar.
