An environmental organization is planning to initiate two projects: $X$ for reforestation and $Y$ for wildlife conservation. The projects require funds and the organization aims to minimize the total cost while meeting certain objectives. Each unit of funding for project $X$ costs $\$100$, and for project $Y$, it costs $\$200$. However, due to budget constraints, the total funds allocated to both projects combined cannot exceed 50 units.\n\nTo ensure balanced resource allocation, the combined effectiveness of these projects must meet a minimum threshold: three times the fund allocation for project X minus that of project Y should be at least 10 units.\n\nGiven that there are further constraints on individual fund allocations due to other factors (like manpower or resource availability): Project X can receive anywhere between 0 to 30 units of funding, while Project Y can receive between 0 to 20 units. Considering that these fund allocations must be in whole numbers due to practicality reasons, what is the minimum total cost required in dollars for these initiatives? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
