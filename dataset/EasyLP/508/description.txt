In an energy optimization scenario, a company needs to allocate resources across three projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total investment across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Additionally, the company has several requirements for these investments: the value of five times the investment in project X minus twice the investment in project Y must be at least 200 units; the difference between the investments in project Z and project Y should not exceed 300 units; and finally, the investment in project X must be at least 50 units more than that of project Z.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ yields different returns or costs, quantified as 2 , 3 , and 4 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of investments due to practicalities, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
