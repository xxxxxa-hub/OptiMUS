An environmental agency is planning to allocate resources for three projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different initiatives such as forest restoration, wildlife conservation, and pollution control. The total allocation across all three projects has several constraints due to budgetary limitations and project requirements. The combined allocation for projects $X$ and $Y$ cannot exceed 2000 units, while the sum of the allocations for projects $X$ and $Z$ must be at least 1000 units. Furthermore, the difference between the allocations for projects $Y$ and $Z$ must exactly equal 500 units, reflecting specific project interdependencies. Additionally, the difference between the allocations for project X and Y should not be less than -700.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to projects X, Y, and Z incurs costs of 50 , 60 , and 70 units respectively. The agency aims to minimize these costs while ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to contractual or logistical reasons. Each project also has a maximum limit on resource allocation: X can receive up to 1500 units; Y up to 1300 units; Z up to 1200 units.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost (in cost-units) needed by this environmental agency for optimal resource allocation among these three initiatives? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
