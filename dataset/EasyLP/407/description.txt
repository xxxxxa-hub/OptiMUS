A shipping company is planning to distribute its fleet of trucks among four routes: X1, X2, X3, and X4. The cost per truck for each route are 4, 5, 6, and 7 units respectively. To ensure a balanced distribution of resources and adherence to specific route requirements:\n\n- The combined number of trucks on routes X1 and X2 cannot exceed 50.- Similarly, the combined number of trucks on routes X3 and X4 cannot exceed 80.\n- At least 30 trucks must be allocated to routes X1 and X3 combined.- At least 40 trucks must be allocated to routes X2 and X4 combined.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the fact that the number of trucks for each route (X1, X2, X3, and X4) must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated within their respective bounds:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost for the company given these optimal allocation conditions? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole unit.
