A manufacturing company is planning to allocate resources among four different production lines: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These could involve producing different types of products or components. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these production lines, with costs being 20, 30, 40, and 50 units for x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and production capacities:\n- The combined resource allocation for production lines x1 and x2 cannot exceed 200 units.\n- Twice the resources allocated to line x1 combined with three times those allocated to line x3 must be at least 150 units. This may reflect certain minimum production targets or quality standards.\n- The difference between half the resources for line x4 and those for line x1 should not exceed 75 units. This could be due to a need for balancing output across different product categories.\n- Lastly, the sum of resources allocated to line x3 and half those allocated to line X4 minus the resources used in Line X2 should be at least 100 units. This could reflect strategic priorities or market demand patterns.\n\nGiven these conditions along with requirement that all allocations are integers because of practical considerations (such as labor hours or machine usage), what is the minimum total cost when optimal resource allocation within specific bounds on each production line is achieved? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
