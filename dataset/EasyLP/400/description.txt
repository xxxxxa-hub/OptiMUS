A military general is planning the allocation of resources between four types of units: X1, X2, X3 and X4 for an upcoming operation. The total number of units for type X1 and X2 combined cannot exceed 200 due to logistical constraints, and similarly the total number of units for type X3 and X4 combined cannot exceed 150. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined strength calculated as 5 times the unit count for type X1 plus 10 times the unit count for type X2 must be at least 1000. Similarly, another strategic objective requires that the combined strength calculated as 7.5 times the unit count for type X3 plus 5 times the unit count for type X4 must be at least 750. Each unit of types X1, X2, X3 and X4 requires \$5000, \$7000, \$10000 and \$3000 respectively in funding. The general aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints (X1,X2,X3,X4 are integers). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this operation in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar.
