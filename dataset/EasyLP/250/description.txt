A manager is scheduling three types of tasks: $X, Y$, and $Z$. Each task type requires a different amount of time to complete, with task $X$ taking 1 hour, task $Y$ taking 2 hours, and task $Z$ taking 3 hours. The manager has the following constraints on their schedule:\n\n- The combined time for twice as many task $X$ plus task $Y$ cannot exceed 6 hours.- The combined time for task $X$ and task $Z$ must not exceed 5 hours.- The total time spent on tasks $Y$ and $Z$ must be at least 7 hours.\n\nAll tasks must be completed in whole numbers due to the nature of the tasks. What is the minimum total number of hours required to complete all these tasks while adhering to these constraints?
