A farmer is planning to allocate resources for the cultivation of three crops: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total combined area for cultivation cannot exceed 500 acres due to land limitations. To ensure a diverse yield, the combined area of twice crop X and crop Y must be at least 200 acres. Moreover, the difference in area between crops Y and Z should not exceed 50 acres, maintaining a balanced production volume across all crops. Furthermore, the area allocated to crop X must be at least twice that of half of crop Z's area by at least 100 acres.\n\nThe cost per acre for cultivating each crop varies with \$100 for Crop X, \$50 for Crop Y, and \$75 for Crop Z. Given that the farmer aims to minimize the total cultivation cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all areas are whole numbers due to practicality considerations,\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost (in dollars) required? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
