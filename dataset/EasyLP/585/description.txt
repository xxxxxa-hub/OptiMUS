A marketing manager is planning a campaign and needs to allocate the budget across four channels: TV, Radio, Social Media, and Outdoor advertising. The cost per unit of effectiveness for each channel are 0.5 for TV, 0.6 for Radio, 0.8 for Social Media and 1.2 for Outdoor advertising.\n\nThe following conditions must be met:\n- The combined budget allocated to TV and Radio should be at least 500 units to ensure sufficient reach.\n- The difference between the budgets allocated to Social Media and Radio should not exceed 200 units in order to maintain a balanced mix of traditional and digital media.\n- The budget allocated to Outdoor advertising should exceed that of TV by at least 100 units as part of a strategy to increase outdoor visibility.\n- The sum of the budgets allocated to Social Media and Outdoor advertising should not exceed 800 units due to limited resources in these areas.\n\nEach channel has specific bounds on budget allocation due to various constraints such as availability of airtime or billboard space:\nThe maximum possible allocation is up to 700 units for TV, up to 600 units for Radio, up to 500 units for Social Media, and up to 400 units for Outdoor Advertising. Note that all allocations must be whole numbers due to minimum purchase requirements associated with each type of media buy.\n\nGiven these conditions, what would be the minimum total cost (in thousands) needed in order to conduct this marketing campaign? Provide your answer rounded off two decimal places.
