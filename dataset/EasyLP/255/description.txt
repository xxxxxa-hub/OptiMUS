In a supply chain optimization problem, a manager needs to allocate resources across three processes: $x1$, $x2$, and $x3$. These could represent different stages in the production or distribution of goods. The manager aims to minimize the total cost associated with these processes, with costs being 5, 4, and 6 units for $x1$, $x2$, and $x3$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and operational requirements:- The combined resource allocation for process $x1$ and process $x2$ cannot exceed 100 units.- The sum of twice the allocation for process $x1$ plus thrice the allocation for process $x3$ must be at least 150 units. This might reflect a minimum production requirement.- The allocation for four times process $x2$ minus that of process $x3$ must not exceed 200 units. This could reflect capacity constraints or balancing of activities within the supply chain.\n\nGiven these constraints, along with bounds on resource allocation specific to each process (due to factors such as equipment capacity or manpower), find out what is the minimum total cost given optimal integer allocations to all three processes rounded off to nearest whole number?
