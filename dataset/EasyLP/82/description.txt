A construction company is planning the allocation of resources between two types of materials, $X$ and $Y$, for an upcoming project. There are no lower limits on the amounts of either material that can be used, but due to budget constraints, the total amount of both materials combined cannot exceed 2000 units. To ensure structural integrity, the combined strength of these materials must yield a minimum score, calculated as 3 times the quantity of material X plus 4 times the quantity of material Y, of at least 5000 points. Given that the cost per unit for material $X$ is $\$5$ and for material $Y$ is $\$10$, and the company aims to minimize total cost while meeting all constraints (with quantities being whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of units). What is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to nearest dollar?
