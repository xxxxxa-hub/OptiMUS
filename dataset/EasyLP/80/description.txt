A construction manager is planning to allocate resources between two types of tasks, $X$ and $Y$. Each task requires a specific number of hours and the total hours available cannot exceed 20. Specifically, each task of type $X$ requires 5 hours and each task of type $Y$ requires 3 hours. However, due to the project requirements, the combined effort from these tasks must yield a minimum productivity score calculated as twice the number of $X$ tasks plus four times the number of $Y$ tasks, which should be at least 10 points. Given that the cost per unit for task $X$ is $\$50$, and for task $Y$, it's $\$80$, and considering that both X and Y are integers due to their nature (as one can't complete half a task), what is the minimum total cost in dollars required to meet all constraints? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
