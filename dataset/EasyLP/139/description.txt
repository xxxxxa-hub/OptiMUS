In a military logistics operation, an officer needs to distribute resources between two types of units: X and Y. The total number of units that can be distributed is limited to 1000 due to logistical constraints. For achieving strategic objectives, the combined strength of 2 units of X and 1 unit of Y must be at least 500. Each unit of X requires 500 support points and each unit of Y requires 300 support points. Also, there are specific bounds on the allocation for both X (0 to 700) and Y (0 to 400). Given that the allocations for X and Y must be integers due to the nature of the units, calculate the minimum total support points required if we aim to minimize them while adhering to these constraints.
