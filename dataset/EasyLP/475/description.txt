A tourism manager is planning the allocation of resources between two types of tourist packages, X and Y. The total number of packages that can be offered is limited to 50 due to logistical constraints. To maintain a diverse offering, the combined number of package X and package Y should be at least 10. Additionally, to maintain balance in the offerings, the number of package X should not exceed twice the number of package Y by more than 20 packages.\n\nEach package X requires 100 units of resources and each package Y requires 150 units. Given these conditions, if all numbers are whole numbers due to indivisible nature of the packages, what is the minimum amount of resources required for this operation? Provide your answer in units rounded to nearest whole number.
