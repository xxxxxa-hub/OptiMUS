A retail manager is planning to order three types of products for the upcoming season: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total number of units ordered cannot exceed 5000 due to storage limitations. To maintain a diverse product range, the number of product X units ordered must be at least 1000 more than half the number of product Y units. Additionally, to avoid overstocking on high-value items, the number of product Z units should not exceed 75% of the number of product X units by more than 1500.\n\nThe unit costs for products X, Y, and Z are $\$5$, $\$10$, and $\$20$ respectively. The retail manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all orders are in whole numbers due to packaging restrictions.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar.
