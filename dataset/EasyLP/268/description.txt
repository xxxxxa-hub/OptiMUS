In a human resources management scenario, a company needs to allocate employees across three departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different business units or functional areas within the organization. The total number of employees that can be allocated is limited to 100 due to constraints in office space and managerial capacity. The number of employees in department $X$ should be at least twice the half of those in department $Y$ to ensure adequate staffing for project management roles. Also, the number of employees in department $Z$ should not exceed by more than 10 the three-fourths of those in department $X$ as this could overstretch supervisory capacities.\n\nEach employee's average cost (salary and benefits) differs among departments, with costs being $\$5000$, $\$4000$, and $\$6000$ for departments $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, respectively. The HR manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these staffing constraints, ensuring that all allocations are integers due to the indivisible nature of human resources.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost for optimal staff allocation across the three departments? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
