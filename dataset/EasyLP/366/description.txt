A construction company has four types of machinery: $X, Y, Z$, and $W$. The rental cost per day for each type is $\$4000$ for $X$, $\$3000$ for $Y$, $\$6000$ for $Z$, and $\$5000$ for $W$. Due to budget constraints, the company can only rent a total of 50 machines from group X and Y combined, and a total of 40 machines from group Z and W combined. To meet project requirements, at least 30 machines must be rented from group X or Z combined, and at least 20 machines must be rented from group Y or W combined. There are also additional constraints on the number of each type of machine that can be rented: a maximum of 30 for X, 25 for Y, 20 for Z, and 15 for W. Given that the company aims to minimize rental costs while meeting all project requirements (with all rentals being integers due to the nature of the machines), what is the minimum possible total daily rental cost in dollars?
