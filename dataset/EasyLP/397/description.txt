An environmental management agency is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These projects could involve reforestation, water conservation, air quality improvement, and waste management respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 5, 7, 3, and 4 units for x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary restrictions and project requirements:- The combined resource allocation for twice the allocation for x1 plus the allocation for x2 minus half of the allocation for x3 cannot exceed 50 units.- The allocation for one unit of x1 plus two-and-a-half times the allocation for project X2 minus project X4 must be at least 30 units.- The resource allotment equivalent to three-quarters of project X1's allocation subtracted from that of Project X3's and added to that of Project X4's should not exceed 20 units.- An amount derived from subtracting a unit each from Projects X1 and X2's allocations then adding six-tenths of Project X4's should be at least equal to or more than ten.\n\nGiven these conditions along with specific bounds on resource distribution (from zero up until their respective maximums) across all four initiatives,What would be the minimum total cost while ensuring whole number allocations due to indivisible nature of resources? Provide your answer rounded off.
