A retail store manager is planning the stock levels for two types of products, X and Y. The total number of items that can be stocked is limited to 1000 due to storage constraints. To ensure a balanced product offering, the combined quantity of twice the number of X products and Y products must be at least 500. Additionally, the difference in quantity between product X and twice the quantity of product Y should not exceed 200 to maintain a proper inventory balance. Each unit of product X and Y has associated stocking costs of $5 and $10 respectively, which includes procurement cost, storage cost, etc., with an objective to minimize these costs while adhering to all the constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that quantities must be whole numbers due to their physical nature, calculate the minimum total stocking cost required for this scenario (in dollars), rounded off to nearest dollar.
