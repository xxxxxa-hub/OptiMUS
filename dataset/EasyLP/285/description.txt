A tourism company is planning to allocate resources across three different tour packages: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These packages could represent different types of tours such as adventure, cultural, and luxury respectively. The total number of tours across all three packages cannot exceed 50 due to operational constraints. Each package has a specific rating associated with it - package $X$ has a rating of 5, package $Y$ a rating of 3 and package $Z$ a rating of 7. To maintain the quality standards, the combined ratings from all the tours must be at least 100. Furthermore, to cater for diverse customer preferences, the company wants to offer at least 10 more tours in package $X$ than in package $Y$. The cost per tour are \$500 for X, \$300 for Y and \$700 for Z respectively.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the fact that the number of tours must be whole numbers due to practical reasons (you can't have half or fractional number of tours), and each tour package has specific upper limits on resource allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars required by this tourism company while adhering to these constraints if they aim for optimal allocation? Please round your answer off to nearest dollar.
