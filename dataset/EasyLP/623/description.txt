In a supply chain optimization scenario, a company needs to allocate resources across four different processes: $X1, X2, X3$, and $X4$. These processes could represent procurement of raw materials, manufacturing, warehousing & logistics, and distribution respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these processes. Each process incurs costs quantified as 4 units for $X1$, 3 units for $X2$, 5 units for $X3$ and 6 units for $X4$.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary restrictions and operational limitations:\n\n- The combined resource allocation for $X1$ and $X2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The sum of twice the resources allocated to $X2$ and those allocated to $X3$ should be at least 500 units.\n- Resources allocated to half of those in operation $X3$ minus those in operation $X1$ must not exceed 200 units.\n- The difference between resources allocated to operations $X4$ and operation $X2$ must be no less than -400.\n- Furthermore, there is a constraint that dictates that the difference between resources allocated to operations .8 times of those in operation X4 minus those in operation X3 should be no more than -300.\n\nGiven these conditions along with bounds on each process' resource allocations (which are all integers), what would be the minimum possible total cost (in unit cost) under optimal resource allocation? Please provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
