A manufacturing company is planning the production of three types of products: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These products could represent different models or categories of goods produced by the company. The total production quantity across all three products cannot exceed 1000 units due to factory capacity constraints. For meeting market demand, the combined production of 3 units of product $X$ and 4 units of product $Y$ must be at least 600 units. Additionally, for maintaining a balanced inventory, the difference between 5 times the production quantity of product $Z$ and that of product $Y$ must not exceed 200 units.\n\nThe cost per unit for producing products $X, Y$, and $Z$ are given as $\$50$, $\$30$, and $\$20$, respectively. The company aims to minimize the total production cost while adhering to these constraints. Moreover, because each unit represents a whole item that cannot be fractionally produced (due to its indivisible nature), the production quantities for each product type should be integer values.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this manufacturing scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
