An energy company is planning to produce electricity from three different sources: coal, gas, and nuclear. The total production of electricity from these sources must be at least 500 MW to meet the demand. There are also additional constraints due to environmental regulations and safety requirements:\n\n- A measure calculated as half the production from coal minus a fifth of the production from gas plus the entire production from nuclear must not exceed 200.\n- Another measure computed as the production from coal minus the production from gas plus forty percent of the nuclear power generation must be at least 150.\n\nThe cost per unit of electricity produced by each source is $\$20$ for coal, $\$30$ for gas, and $\$40$ for nuclear power. The company aims to minimize its total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all productions are in whole numbers due to technical limitations in measurements.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this company's electricity generation plan, rounded to the nearest dollar?
