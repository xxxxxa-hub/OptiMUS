An environmental agency is planning two major projects, X and Y, to mitigate the effects of climate change. The agency needs to allocate its resources effectively while minimizing the overall cost associated with these projects. The costs for implementing projects X and Y are $20$ and $30$ per unit respectively.\n\nThe total resource allocation across both projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. To ensure a balanced approach towards both initiatives, the difference in resource allocation between project X and project Y must be at least 200 units. Moreover, twice the resources allocated to project X combined with those for project Y should not exceed 1500 units.\n\nConsidering that each project has specific bounds on resource allocation (with a maximum of 800 units for Project X and 600 units for Project Y), what is the minimum total cost for implementing these projects? Provide your answer in dollars, rounded to the nearest whole dollar, under the condition that all allocations are in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources.
