A manufacturing company is planning to allocate resources between four different production lines: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. The aim is to minimize the total cost of production, where the costs per unit produced for each line are $\$10$, $\$15$, $\$20$, and $\$25$, respectively. The company has several constraints due to capacity limitations:\n\n- The combined output from lines $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- Twice the output of line $x3$ plus thrice that of line $x4$ should not surpass 1500 units.\n- The difference in output between line $x2$ and the sum of lines $x1$ and $x3$ must be at least 300 units, considering specific requirements for diversification.\n- The difference between the outputs of lines $x3$ and the sum of lines $x2$ and $x4$ must not exceed 500 units in order to maintain a balanced product portfolio.\n\nGiven these conditions, along with the requirement that the number of units produced on each line (represented by variables x1, x2, x3, and x4) are integers due to practical considerations. Each production line also has specific bounds on output volume:\nWhat would be the minimum total cost for this manufacturer given optimal allocation of resources to all four production lines within specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
