A marketing firm is planning the distribution of their budget between three different advertising channels: X, Y, and Z. The total budget for channel X and Y combined cannot exceed \$1000 due to limited resources. Similarly, the combined budget for channels Y and Z cannot surpass \$800. However, to meet the campaign's reach and frequency objectives, the combined effort of channels X and Z must yield a minimum expenditure of at least \$500. Given that the cost per unit of effectiveness for channel X is \$5, for channel Y is \$4, and for channel Z is \$3, while trying to minimize the total cost(X,Y,Z are integers). Find out what would be the minimum possible total cost in dollars? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
