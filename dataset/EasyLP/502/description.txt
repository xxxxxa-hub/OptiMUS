A real estate developer is planning to invest in two types of properties: residential ($X$) and commercial ($Y$). The company has a constraint that the total number of properties it can invest in cannot exceed 100. The company also needs to meet certain criteria related to return on investment (ROI) and risk diversification. For ROI, the combined average monthly rental income from 30% of residential properties and 40% of commercial properties must be at least $30$. In terms of risk diversification, the difference between half the number of residential properties and one-fifth the number of commercial properties should not exceed $40$. Furthermore, each property type has a minimum investment requirement due to market factors: at least $10$ for residential and $5$ for commercial. Given that the cost per unit for investing in residential and commercial properties is $\$50000$ and $\$70000$, respectively, while considering all constraints are met(both X,Y are integers), what would be the minimum total cost rounded to nearest dollar?
