A supply chain manager needs to distribute resources between two warehouse facilities, X and Y. The total amount of resources available for both warehouses combined is limited to 1000 units due to logistical constraints. To ensure efficient operations, the combined resource allocation of twice the number of units for warehouse X and the number of units for warehouse Y must be at least 800 units. Additionally, to maintain a balance in resource distribution, the difference in resource allocation between warehouses X and Y should not exceed 200 units.\n\nThe cost per unit of resource allocated is $4 for warehouse X and $3 for warehouse Y. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Given that the allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars for this operation, rounded to the nearest dollar?
