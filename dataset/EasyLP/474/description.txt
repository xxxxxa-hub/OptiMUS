A tourism company is planning to organize two types of tours: $X$ and $Y$. The total number of tours that can be organized is limited to 50 due to the available resources. To achieve a balance in the variety of experiences offered, the combined number of twice the tour X and four times the tour Y must be at least 40. Additionally, three times the number of tour X minus that for tour Y should not exceed 60 to maintain a reasonable diversity.\n\nEach tour type incurs different costs, with each unit of Tour $X$ costing \$500 and each unit of Tour $Y$ costing \$1000. The company aims to minimize these costs while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the numbers of both types are integers due to practical considerations.\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost for organizing these tours within these constraints? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole dollar.
