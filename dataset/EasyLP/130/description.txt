An environmental organization is planning to initiate two projects for the conservation of nature: Project $X$ and Project $Y$. These projects could involve activities like tree plantation, clean-up drives, awareness campaigns, etc. The total cost associated with these projects are $0.5$ units per activity for project $X$ and $0.3$ units per activity for project $Y$, respectively.\n\nHowever, there are certain constraints on how many activities can be carried out due to limited resources and manpower:\n- The combined number of activities for 2 times Project X and 3 times Project Y cannot exceed 5000.\n- Additionally, the difference in activities between Project X and Project Y must be at least 100 to maintain a balance in initiatives.\n\nGiven that the number of activities undertaken in each project should be integers (as we cannot have fractional activities), what is the minimum possible total cost (in units) required to conduct these projects while adhering to these constraints? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest integer.
