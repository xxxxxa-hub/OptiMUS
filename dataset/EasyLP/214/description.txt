A retail store manager is planning to allocate resources across three different departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent investments in different areas such as inventory, marketing, and infrastructure respectively. The total resource allocation across all three departments cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Department $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 200 units to maintain operations, while department $Y$ requires at least 150 units for its activities. Similarly, department $Z$ needs a minimum allocation of 100 units. Each unit of investment in departments $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs of 50 , 60 , and 70 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded off to the nearest dollar?
