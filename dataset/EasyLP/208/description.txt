A healthcare system is planning to allocate resources across three key areas: medical staff (X), facilities (Y), and technology (Z). The total investment across all three areas cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. At least 200 units must be allocated to medical staff, at least 150 units for facilities, and a minimum of 100 units should go towards technology investments. Each unit of investment in medical staff, facilities, and technology incurs costs of 10, 15, and 20 units respectively. The healthcare system aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all investments are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
