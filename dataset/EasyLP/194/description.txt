A transportation company has three types of vehicles: X, Y, and Z. The company aims to minimize the total cost associated with these vehicles, with costs being $\$5$, $\$4$, and $\$3$ per vehicle for X, Y, and Z respectively.\n\nThe allocation of vehicles must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and operational requirements:- The combined number of all types of vehicles cannot exceed 1000.- The number of twice type X plus type Y vehicles must be at least 200.- The number of type X plus type Z vehicles cannot exceed 300.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that the allocations for X, Y, and Z must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of a single vehicle:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for operating these vehicles in dollars under optimal conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
