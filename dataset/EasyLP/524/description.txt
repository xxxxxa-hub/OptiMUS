In a healthcare setting, a hospital administrator is planning the allocation of weekly work hours among three groups of staff: nurses (X), doctors (Y), and administrative personnel (Z). The objective is to optimize patient care by minimizing total staffing costs. The cost per hour for each group are $\$500$ for nurses, $\$300$ for doctors, and $\$700$ for administrative personnel.\n\nThe hospital has certain constraints for their weekly schedule:\n- The combined work hours across all groups cannot exceed 100 hours due to budgetary restrictions.\n- To maintain a balanced patient care ratio, the difference in work hours between nurses and doctors must be at least 10.\n- Additionally, the difference in work hours between administrative personnel and nurses should not exceed 20 to ensure efficient operations.\n- Furthermore, there must be at least 30 more hours allocated to administrative tasks than doctor's hours to manage hospital paperwork efficiently.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of working hours due to scheduling practicalities within specified bounds for each group:\n What is the minimum total staffing cost for the hospital given an optimal allocation of weekly working hours among the three groups (X, Y, Z)? Provide the answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
