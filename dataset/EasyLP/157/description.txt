A real estate investor is planning to invest in two types of properties, $X$ and $Y$. The investor cannot purchase more than a total of 1000 properties due to financial constraints. To ensure diversity in the investment portfolio, the number of type $X$ properties purchased should be at least three times the number of type $Y$ properties sold. Each property of type $X$ costs $\$300,000$, and each property of type $Y$ costs $\$200,000$. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of properties due to the nature of real estate transactions, what is the minimum total cost for purchasing these properties? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
