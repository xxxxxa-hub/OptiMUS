A real estate developer is planning to invest in three types of properties: residential (X), commercial (Y), and industrial (Z). The developer has a maximum budget that can finance up to 50 properties. Each property type comes with different costs: \$10,000 for residential, \$15,000 for commercial, and \$20,000 for industrial.\n\nThe investment strategy must follow these constraints:\n- The combined number of all types of properties cannot exceed 50 due to the limited budget.\n- The number of residential properties should be at least twice as many as commercial ones to maintain a balanced portfolio. Hence, the total number of residential and commercial properties should be at least 30.\n- To avoid overexposure in the high-risk segments, the total number of commercial and industrial properties should not exceed 40.\n\nMoreover, each type has its own restrictions on the maximum number that can be invested: no more than 20 residential properties due to market saturation; no more than 15 commercial properties because of zoning laws; and no more than 25 industrial properties owing to environmental regulations. Given that investments have to be made in whole numbers as partial property purchases are not allowed,\n\nWhat would be the minimum possible investment cost for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
