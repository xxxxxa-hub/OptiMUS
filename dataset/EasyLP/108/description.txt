A sports coach needs to plan the training sessions for two types of exercises, $X$ and $Y$, over a week. The total time spent on both exercises cannot exceed 20 hours due to athletes' physical limits. Moreover, the time spent on exercise $X$ should be at least 5 hours more than that on exercise $Y$ as it is deemed more crucial for their performance.\n\nEach hour of training in exercise $X$ causes a fatigue score of 2 units, while each hour in exercise $Y$ causes a fatigue score of 3 units. The coach aims to minimize the total fatigue score while ensuring all constraints are met. Also note that due to scheduling practicalities, the hours allocated for each type of exercise can only be whole numbers.\n\nGiven that the maximum time that can be allocated to exercise $X$ and $Y$ is respectively limited to 15 hours and 10 hours due to additional constraints (such as availability of facilities or trainers), what is the minimum total fatigue score possible under these conditions? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
