In a financial planning scenario, an investor is considering four types of investment vehicles: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and gold. The objective is to optimize the portfolio by minimizing the total cost associated with these investments. The costs associated with each type of investment are 5 for stocks, 6 for bonds, 7 for mutual funds and 8 for gold (in units of $1000).\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to risk management considerations and market conditions:\n- The difference between the amount invested in stocks and that in bonds cannot exceed $5000.\n- The amount invested in mutual funds should be at least $3000 more than that in gold.\n- The total investment across all four vehicles should not exceed $10000.\n- A minimum of $2000 should be allocated to stocks.\n- A maximum of $4000 can be allocated to bonds.\n\nAdditionally, each type of investment has its own specific bounds on allocation:\n- Between $1000 and $5000 can be allocated to stocks.\n- Between $500 and $3000 can be allocated to bonds.\n- At least $2000 must be invested in mutual funds.\n- At least $1500 must be invested in gold.\n\nGiven these constraints and objectives along with the requirement that all investments are made in whole numbers (due to trading unit restrictions), what is the minimum total cost for this financial plan given optimal allocations within specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest thousand dollars.
