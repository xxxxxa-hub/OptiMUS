A manufacturing company is planning to minimize its production costs which are associated with raw materials, labor hours, machine hours and energy usage. The cost per unit for each of these resources are $10$, $5$, $15$ and $20$ respectively. To ensure the quality and efficiency of the production process, several constraints need to be met:\n\n- The quantity of raw materials used should be at least twice that of labor hours utilized.\n- Labor hours used cannot exceed the machine hours operated.\n- Machine hours operated must equal the energy usage in order to maintain operational efficiency.\n- The combined total units for all four resources (raw materials, labor hours, machine hours and energy usage) must be at least 500 units to meet minimum production requirements.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that resource allocation can only be in whole numbers due to practical reasons, what is the minimum total cost that the company needs to incur while adhering to all these constraints? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest dollar.
