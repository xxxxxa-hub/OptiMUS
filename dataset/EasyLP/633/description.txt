A sports team manager is planning the allocation of resources to four different departments: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These could represent departments like player recruitment (x1), equipment management (x2), medical staff (x3), and coaching staff (x4). The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these departments, with costs being 4, 3, 5, and 6 units for x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for department x1 and twice the allocation for department x2 cannot be less than 10 units.\n- The difference between twice the allocation for department x3 and that for department x4 cannot exceed 15 units.\n- The combined resources allocated to departments x1 and x3 minus thrice those allocated to department X2 should be exactly equal to 8 units.\n- Lastly,the sum of allocations made to departments X2 and X4 subtracted from that made to department X1 should not exceed 25 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with individual bounds on resource allocation per department - \nx1: [0-30],\nx2: [0-20],\nx3: [0-40],\nx4: [0-50]\n\nand assuming all allocations are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources,\nThe question is : What is the minimum total cost for managing all these departments under optimal resource allocation within specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest integer.
