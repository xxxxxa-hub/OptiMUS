A retail manager is planning the allocation of resources to four different departments: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These could involve stocking different categories of products such as electronics (x1), clothing (x2), groceries (x3), and home goods (x4). The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these departments, with costs being 5, 3, 2, and 7 units for x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and store space:- The combined resource allocation for twice the amount for electronics (x1) and thrice the amount for clothing (x2) cannot exceed 150 units.- The allocation for electronics (x1) plus home goods(x4) must be at least 30 units.- The difference between allocations for groceries (x3) and home goods(x4) should not exceed 10 units.- Resource allocation considering four times electronics(x1), five times clothing(x2) along with groceries(x3) should be a minimum of 80 units.\n\nGiven that each department has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for managing all departments within specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
