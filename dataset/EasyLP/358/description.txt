A retail store manager is planning to allocate funds to four departments: $X1$, $X2$, $X3$, and $X4$. These could represent different sections of the store like electronics, clothing, home decor, and groceries respectively. The objective is to minimize the total expenditure while ensuring all department needs are met. The costs associated with each unit of fund allocation are 2, 3, 4, and 5 units for departments $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ and $X4$ respectively.\n\nThe fund allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic priorities:\n- The combined funds allocated to departments $X1$ and $X2$ cannot exceed 2000 units.\n- Twice the funds allocated for department $X3$ plus thrice that of department $X4$ should be at least 3000 units reflecting specific operational requirements.\n- The difference in funds between department $X1$ and department $X4$ should not exceed 500 units ensuring balanced resource distribution.\n- Department $X2$ should receive at least 1000 more units than department X3 as per store's strategic focus.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that all allocations are in whole numbers due to accounting rules and each department has a certain bounds on fund allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total expenditure for the store manager given optimal fund allocation among all four departments within specified bounds? Please round your answer to nearest whole number.
