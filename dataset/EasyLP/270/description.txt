A human resources manager is planning the distribution of new hires across three different departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. Each department corresponds to a specific function in the company, such as sales, marketing, or product development. The cost of hiring an employee for each department differs due to varying salary levels, training requirements, and recruitment expenses. Specifically, it costs \$5000 to hire an employee for department X, \$6000 for department Y, and \$7000 for department Z.\n\nThe total number of new hires cannot exceed 100 due to budget constraints. Moreover, there are strategic priorities that necessitate certain staffing ratios between the departments:\n- The number of employees in department X must be at least 10 more than twice the number of employees in department Y.- The number of employees in department Y must be at least 5 more than those in department Z.\n\nAdditionally, there are capacity limits on how many new hires each department can accommodate:- Department X can hire up to 50 employees.- Department Y can hire up to 30 employees.- Department Z can hire up to 20 employees.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of new hires due to practicalities related to individual employment contracts (employees cannot be hired fractionally), what is the minimum total cost required for this hiring plan? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
