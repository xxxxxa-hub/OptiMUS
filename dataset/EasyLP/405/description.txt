A shipping company is planning to allocate cargo capacity between four different ships: $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$. Each ship carries a different type of cargo, resulting in different revenue rates per unit of cargo. The revenue rates are $4$, $3$, $5$, and $6$ units for $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$ respectively. The total cargo capacity for ships $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units due to size limitations of the port they operate from. Similarly, the combined capacity for ships $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 800 units due to their operating conditions.\n\nThe company also has contracts that require at least a certain amount of each type of cargo to be shipped. These requirements are expressed as weighted sums: \n- Half the load on ship x1 plus a quarter of the load on ship x2 must be at least 300 units.- Three-quarters of the load on ship x3 plus three-fifths of the load on ship x4 must be at least 250 units.\n\nGiven these constraints and the objective function (which aims to minimize total cost), along with the requirement that all loads are whole numbers due to nature of cargos:\n What is the minimum total cost for this operation rounded off to nearest whole number?
