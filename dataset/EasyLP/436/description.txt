A healthcare manager is planning to allocate the budget between two different departments, $X$ and $Y$. The minimum budget for department $X$ cannot be less than $\$ 200$, while for department $Y$, it cannot be less than $\$ 100$. The total budget allocated for both departments combined should not exceed $\$ 1000$. Each unit of allocation in department $X$ costs $\$ 50$, whereas each unit of allocation in department $Y$ costs $\$ 80$. If the manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints (the budgets allocated to X and Y are integers), what would be the minimal total cost? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
