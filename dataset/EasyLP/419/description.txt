In an energy optimization scenario, a company needs to allocate resources between two renewable energy projects: Solar and Wind. The total investment in both projects cannot exceed 80 units due to budget constraints. To meet certain efficiency goals, the combined output of these projects must yield a minimum score calculated as 3 times the investment in Solar plus 2 times the investment in Wind of at least 100 points. Additionally, considering regional climatic conditions, the investment in Solar must be equal or more than that in Wind. Each unit of investment yields different returns or costs for each project: For Solar it is 10 units and for Wind it is 20 units.\n\nThe company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that all investments are integer numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. Also, there are specific upper limits on resource allocation for each project: For Solar it is not more than 50 units and for Wind it's not more than 40 units.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
