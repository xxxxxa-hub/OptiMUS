A supply chain manager is planning the allocation of resources across three distribution channels: X1, X2, and X3. These channels could represent different transportation modes or routes for goods delivery. The total resource allocation across all three channels cannot exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints. Channel X1 requires a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as five times the resources allocated to it minus two and a half times the resources allocated to channel X2, of at least 1000 points. The combined effort from channel X2 and channel X3 should yield an effectiveness score, computed as three times the resources assigned to channel X2 plus four and a half times the resources assigned to channel X3, not exceeding 4000 points. Furthermore, there is a balance requirement between these channels such that the difference in resource allocation between channel X1 and one and a half times that of channel X2 should be equal to the resources allocated to channel x3.\n\nEach unit of resource investment in channels x1,x2,and x3 incurs costs of 10 ,20 ,and 30 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are integers due to their indivisible nature.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario rounded off to nearest whole number?
