An environmental agency is planning two projects: project $X$ for recycling waste materials and project $Y$ for renewable energy development. The agency aims to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, which are estimated at $5$ units for project $X$ and $8$ units for project $Y$. Each unit of cost might represent a certain amount of money, manpower or resources.\n\nThe implementation must follow these constraints due to budgetary and logistical limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for project X and twice that of project Y cannot exceed 50 units, due to limited available resources.\n- To ensure balanced growth in both areas, the combined resource allocation for both projects should be at least 10 units.\n- The difference between the resources allocated to Project Y and half of those allocated to Project X should not exceed 20 units, possibly due to regulatory requirements or strategic considerations.\n\nFurthermore, due to practical considerations related to resource allocations (like personnel or equipment), the allocations must be in whole numbers. Also, each project has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nProject X can use no more than 25 units and no less than zero,\nProject Y can use no more than 30 units and no less than zero.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost (in cost units) required by the environmental agency while ensuring optimal resource allocation across both projects?
