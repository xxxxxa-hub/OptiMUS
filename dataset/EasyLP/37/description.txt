In a finance scenario, an investor is planning to allocate funds between two types of assets: bonds and stocks. The allocations must be in whole numbers due to the nature of these securities. To meet the investment strategy, the combined value of 2 units of bonds and 3 units of stocks should be at least \$50000. Also, the combined value of 3 units of bonds and 2 units of stocks should not exceed \$100000 due to risk management considerations. Each unit of bond and stock incurs costs (could represent fees, charges or minimum investments) quantified as \$7 for bonds and \$5 for stocks respectively. The investor aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this investment plan, rounded to the nearest dollar.
