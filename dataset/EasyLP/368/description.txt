A construction company has four ongoing projects, denoted as $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ and $X4$. The objective is to minimize the total cost of these projects, with costs being $\$500$, $\$300$, $\$700$, and $\$600$ per unit for $X1$, $X2$, $X3$, and $X4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and project requirements:- The combined resource allocation for projects $X1$ and $X2$ cannot exceed 100 units.- The allocation for twice the amount of resources in project $X3$ plus those in project $X4$ must not exceed 120 units.- The combined resources allocated for projects $X1$ and $X3$ should be at least 60 units.- Similarly, the combined resources allocated for projects $X2$ and $X4$ should be at least 80 units.\n\nGiven these conditions, along with the requirement that all allocations are whole numbers due to practical constraints (like manpower or equipment), what is the minimum total cost, rounded to nearest dollar, if each project has specific bounds on resource allocation? Note: For Project X1 maximum of 50 units can be used. For Project X2 maximum of 60 units can be used. For Project X3 maximum of 40 units can be used. For Project X4 a maximum of 30 units can be used.
