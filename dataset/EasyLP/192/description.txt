A transportation company operates three types of vehicles: X, Y, and Z. Each type of vehicle has different operating costs per day: \$5 for vehicle X, \$7 for vehicle Y, and \$3 for vehicle Z. The company can operate a maximum total of 50 vehicles per day due to staffing constraints. Additionally, the number of type X vehicles operated must be at least 10 more than the number of type Y vehicles to meet specific service requirements. The combined number of type Y and Z vehicles cannot exceed 40 due to maintenance facility limitations. Due to fleet size restrictions, the maximum numbers of each type of vehicle that can be operated are as follows: 20 for type X, 30 for type Y, and 25 for type Z.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of vehicles due to practicalities in scheduling (vehicles cannot be partially used), what is the minimum daily operating cost in dollars that allows the company to meet all constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
