A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, improving data security, and implementing new technologies, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 4 units for project $x1$, 5 units for project $x2$, 6 units for project $x3$ and 7 units for project $x4$.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and operational requirements:\n\n- The combined resource allocation for project $x1$ and twice the allocation for project $x2$ cannot exceed 50 units.\n- The allocation of three times the resources of project $x3$ minus those allocated to project $x4$ must be at least 20 units.\n- The allocation of resources towards projects $x2$ and $x3$, minus those allocated towards project $x1$, should not exceed 30 units.\n- Three times the resource allocation towards project $x4$ minus that allocated towards project $x2$ should be at least 10 units.\n\nEach resource unit can only be allocated in whole numbers due to its indivisible nature. Given that each of these projects has specific bounds on resource allocation (0 -100 for Project X1, 0 -80 for Project X2, 0 -60 for Project X3 and finally from 0 -70 for Project X4), what would be the minimum total cost in unit terms required by the company given optimal allocation? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest integer.
