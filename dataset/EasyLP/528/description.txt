In a retail scenario, a store manager needs to allocate resources across three departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different product categories such as electronics, clothing, and groceries respectively. The total allocation for all three departments cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Department $X$ requires at least 50 more units of allocation than department $Y$ to cater for its higher demand. The difference in resource allocation between department $Z$ and department $X$ should not exceed 200 units to maintain a balanced inventory. The combined resource allocation for departments $Y$ and $Z$ should be at least 400 units to ensure adequate stocking levels.\n\nEach unit of resource allocation incurs costs which are different for each department - calculated as 2 , 3 , and 4 units respectively for departments X, Y, Z. Given these conditions, the store manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Also, considering that allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required under these circumstances? Please provide your answer rounded off to the nearest dollar.
