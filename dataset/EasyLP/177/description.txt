In a national energy policy, the government aims to meet its energy production targets by investing in three types of energy sources: Solar, Wind and Nuclear. The goal is to minimize the total investment cost while meeting certain constraints related to production capacity and strategic planning. The cost per unit of energy produced by Solar, Wind and Nuclear are $10, $15 and $20 respectively.\n\nThe policy has the following conditions:\n- The total combined production from all three sources should be at least 10000 units.\n- The difference in units between Solar and Wind should not exceed 5000 units due to environmental impact considerations.\n- To ensure a balanced portfolio, the amount of energy from Nuclear should be at least 2000 units more than that from Wind. \n\nGiven these conditions and noting that investments must be in whole numbers (due to the indivisible nature of resources), what would be the minimum total investment cost in dollars required for this scenario? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
