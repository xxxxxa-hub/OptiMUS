A farmer is planning to plant three types of crops: Corn, Wheat, and Soybean. The total amount of seeds required for each crop type are represented by the variables 'Corn', 'Wheat', and 'Soybean'. Each unit represents a bag of seeds that can cover one acre, and only whole bags can be used due to practical considerations.\n\nThe farmer has the following constraints for his planting plan:\n\n- He needs to ensure food security, which means twice the acres planted with corn combined with those planted with wheat must be at least 1000.\n- To maintain soil health, the total acres planted with wheat and soybeans cannot exceed 5000.\n- To meet market demand, he needs to plant at least 1000 more acres of corn than soybeans.\n\nGiven that the cost per bag for Corn is $50, for Wheat is $30 and for Soybean is $20. What is the minimum possible cost in dollars needed to fulfill these requirements? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
