In a marketing strategy, a company plans to allocate resources for three activities: Advertising, Promotion, and Sales. Each activity has different costs associated with it: Advertising costs $3 per unit, Promotion costs $2 per unit, and Sales cost $1 per unit. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting the following constraints:- The combined resources allocated for Advertising and Promotion must be at least 10,000 units.- Twice the resources allocated for Advertising plus those allocated for Sales should not exceed 50,000 units.- The resources allocated for Sales minus those allocated for Promotion should be at least 2,000 units.Also note that due to certain limitations or requirements:- The allocation of resources cannot exceed 30,000 units for Advertising,- It cannot exceed 20,000 units for Promotion,- And it cannot exceed 25,000 units for Sales.Assuming all allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of resource distribution,What is the minimum total cost (in dollars) in this scenario? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.
