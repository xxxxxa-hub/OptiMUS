A farmer is planning to plant four different crops: Wheat, Corn, Soybean, and Rice in his field. Due to various factors like the suitability of the crop to the local climate and soil type, the farmer's experience with growing each crop, market prices, etc., the net profit per acre for each crop is different: \$4 for Wheat, \$3 for Corn, \$2 for Soybean, and \$1 for Rice.\n\nThe total area available for planting Wheat and Corn combined cannot exceed 1000 acres due to certain restrictions on these types of crops. Similarly, the total area that can be used to grow Soybean and Rice together is limited to 800 acres due to water availability constraints.\n\nTo maintain a diverse crop portfolio and reduce risk from price fluctuations or disease outbreaks affecting one type of crop more than others, the farmer wants at least 200 more acres of Wheat than Soybean. Also considering marketing strategy and demand-supply balance in local markets, he doesn't want more than 500 acres difference between areas planted with Corn and Rice.\n\nFurthermore,- The maximum area that can be allocated to Wheat is 600 acres.- For Corn it's capped at 400 acres.- Soybean can be grown on up-to 350 acres.- While there are no lower bounds on how much area can be used for any crop (i.e., it could even be zero), but he can't plant more than 300 acres of Rice due to its high water requirement.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the fact that all acreages must be whole numbers as you cannot practically have non-integral amounts of land being cultivated. What should be his planting plan if he wants to maximize his profits? Provide your answer as minimum total cost rounded off to nearest dollar.
