A sports coach is planning the training hours for two groups within the team: group X focuses on stamina building and group Y on skill development. The objective is to optimize the team's performance by minimizing the total fatigue score, which is affected by the training intensity and duration for each group. The fatigue scores associated with each hour of training are 2 for group X and 3 for group Y.\n\nThe team has the following constraints for their weekly training schedule: - The combined hours of stamina building (group X) and skill development (group Y) cannot exceed 100 hours, considering the available facilities and trainers.- To ensure a balanced training program, the number of stamina building (group X) hours must be at least 10 more than that of skill development (group Y).\n- Additionally, twice the number of stamina building (group X) hours plus that of skill development (group Y) must be at least 60 to meet minimum fitness standards.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of training hours due to scheduling practicalities, what is the minimum total fatigue score for the team given an optimal allocation between stamina building (X) and skill development(Y)? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
