A supply chain manager is planning the distribution of resources between two key areas: sourcing (X) and distribution (Y). Both are measured in terms of resource units, and these allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of certain resources. The total available resources for both areas combined cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. To maintain a balanced operation, the sum of twice the allocation for sourcing and the allocation for distribution must be at least 50 units. Furthermore, to prevent over-reliance on one area, the difference between the allocations for sourcing and distribution cannot exceed 30 units.\n\nThe cost per unit of resource allocated is $2$ for sourcing and $3$ for distribution. The supply chain manager aims to minimize this total cost while meeting all operational constraints.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost, in dollars, given these constraints? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
