A manufacturing company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: X1, X2, and X3. These projects could involve upgrading machinery, expanding production lines, and implementing new technologies, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$50 per unit for project X1, \$75 per unit for project X2 and \$120 per unit for project X3.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for all three projects cannot exceed 500 units.\n- The collective effectiveness of five times the resource allocated to project X1 plus ten times that allocated to project X2 must be at least 1000 units.\n- The difference between twice and a half of the resource allocated for project X3 and that allocated for project X1 should not exceed 300 units.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that the allocations for all projects must be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources involved in each task. Each project also has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this manufacturing company when they distribute their resources optimally among these three projects within specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded up to nearest dollar.
