In a human resources scenario, a company needs to allocate manpower across four departments: $X, Y, Z$, and $W$. The total manpower for department $X$ and $Y$ combined cannot exceed 50 due to budget constraints. Department $X$ requires at least 20 employees while department $Y$ can accommodate up to 30 employees only. The sum of employees in departments $Z$ and $W$, minus the number of employees in department X, should not be positive indicating that department X should have more or equal number of employees than the combined total of departments Z and W.\n\nThe cost per employee differs between these departments due to variations in skill requirements and salary levels. Specifically, each employee costs 1.5 units in department X, 2 units in department Y, 3 units in department Z and 4 units in department W. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting all manpower requirements with each employee being considered as an indivisible unit (i.e., no fractional allocations).\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please give your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
