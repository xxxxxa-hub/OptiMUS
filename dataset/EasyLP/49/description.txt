In a healthcare scenario, a hospital manager needs to allocate resources between two services, X and Y. The services could represent different types of medical procedures or patient care activities that require whole numbers of resources due to their nature. The total resource allocation for both services cannot exceed 50 units due to budget constraints. To meet service delivery objectives, the combined effort of these services must yield an effectiveness score calculated as twice the resources for service X plus the resources for service Y, of at least 30 points. Moreover, the difference in resource allocation between service X and twice that of service Y should not exceed 10 units to maintain a balanced approach.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated towards services X and Y incurs costs of $5 and $10 respectively. Given that the hospital manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints (X, Y are integers), find the minimum total cost in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar.
