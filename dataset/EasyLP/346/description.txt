A finance manager is planning to allocate funds across four different investment portfolios: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These portfolios could involve bonds, stocks, real estate, and mutual funds respectively. The objective is to minimize the total risk associated with these investments, with risks being 5, 7, 6, and 8 units for x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to financial regulations and company policies:- The combined investment in portfolio x1 (multiplied by a factor of 3 due to its relative volatility) and portfolio x2 (multiplied by a factor of 4 due to its larger scale) cannot exceed \$5000.- The combined investment in portfolio x1 (multiplied by a factor of 2 due to its relative stability) and portfolio x3 (multiplied by a factor of 5 due to its higher yield potential) cannot exceed \$6000.- The difference between the investments in portfolio x2 and portfolio x4 must be at least \$1000, reflecting strategic diversification requirements.- The difference between the investments in portfolio x1 and three times the investment in portfolio X3 should not exceed \$2000 as it ensures balanced resource distribution.\n\nGiven the constraints along with requirement that all investments are in whole numbers because each unit represents one dollar invested,and each portfolio has specific bounds on fund allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total risk score for the finance manager if he allocates resources optimally among these four portfolios within their respective bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
