A manufacturing company is planning the production of two types of products: $X1$ and $X2$. Due to certain resource constraints, the company has to adhere to the following rules:\n\n- The combined effort of 10 units from product $X1$ and 15 units from product $X2$ cannot exceed 2000 due to machine capacity.\n- To maintain a minimum level of productivity, the combination of 12 units from product $X1$ and 6 units from product $X2$ should be at least 800.\n- The difference between the number of produced units for product $X1$ and half that for product $X2$ should not exceed 100. This is required to ensure a balanced production line.\n\nThe cost per unit for each type of product is different. It costs \$50 to produce one unit of product $X1$, and \$75 for one unit of product $X2$. The company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these requirements. Furthermore, due to manufacturing restrictions, they can only produce whole numbers of products.\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
