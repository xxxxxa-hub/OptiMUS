A shipping company is planning to distribute resources across three different shipment types: $X1, X2$, and $X3$. The total number of shipments for all three types cannot exceed 1000 due to capacity constraints. In order to maintain a balanced service portfolio, the company has determined that twice the number of type $X1$ shipments minus thrice the number of type $X2$ shipments must be at least 200. Moreover, four times the number of type $X3$ shipments minus those of type $X1$ should not exceed 500.\n\nThe costs associated with each shipment type are as follows: Type $X1$: \$5 per shipment, Type $X2$: \$8 per shipment, and Type $X3$: \$6 per shipment. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of shipments due to practical considerations (i.e., you can't have a fraction of a shipment), what is the minimum total cost for distributing resources across these three types while adhering to all the mentioned constraints? Please provide your answer in dollars rounded off to the nearest whole dollar.
