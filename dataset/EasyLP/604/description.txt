A retail manager is planning to allocate the available budget among four departments: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. The total allocation for departments $x1$ and $x2$ must be exactly 400 units, with department $x1$ not receiving more than 300 units and department $x2$ not receiving more than 200 units. Similarly, the total allocation for departments $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 1000 units, with each department having a maximum limit of 500 and 700 units respectively. Furthermore, it's required that the combined allocations for departments x3 and x4 should be at least equal to those of both departments x1 and x2.\n\nThe cost per unit allocated to each department varies: for department x1 it's \$20, for x2 it's \$15, for x3 it's \$10, while for x4 it's only \$5. As a savvy manager aiming to minimize costs while meeting all requirements (and bearing in mind that allocations must be in whole numbers due to accounting regulations), what is the minimum possible total cost in dollars? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
