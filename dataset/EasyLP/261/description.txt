A human resources manager is planning to hire new employees for three different departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The cost of hiring an employee for department $X$ is $\$5000$, for department $Y$ it's $\$4000$, and for department $Z$ it's $\$6000$. The company has a policy to hire exactly 50 new employees this year. To meet the diversity objectives, the total experience score, calculated as 5 times the number of hires in department X plus 3 times the number of hires in department Y plus 7 times the number of hires in department Z, must be at least 200. Moreover, there must be at least 10 employees hired for department X due to its strategic importance and no more than 20 employees can be hired for department Y due to budget constraints. If all hires are whole numbers because you cannot hire fractional people, what is the minimum total cost in dollars that the HR manager needs to spend on hiring new employees this year? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.
