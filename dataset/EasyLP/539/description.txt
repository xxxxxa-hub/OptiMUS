A construction company is planning to allocate resources across three different projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different construction sites or technologies. The total resource allocation across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 200 units to be viable, while project $Y$ needs at least 150 units. Project $Z$, on the other hand, requires a minimum allocation of 100 units.\n\nThere are also some specific conditions related to the distribution of resources among these projects:\n- The resource allocation for project X should not exceed that for project Y by more than 50 units.\n- The resource allocation for project Y should be at least 20 units more than that for project Z.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource varies among the projects: it's $\$300$ for project X, $\$500$ for project Y, and $\$200$ for project Z. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required under this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
