A supply chain manager needs to allocate resources between two distribution centers, $X$ and $Y$. The total resources available are limited to 5000 units due to budget constraints. To ensure a balanced distribution network, the resource allocation for center $X$ should be at least twice that of center $Y$. Furthermore, the combined strength of 2 units in center X and 1 unit in center Y must be at least 1000 units to meet service level requirements. Each unit of resource allocated to centers $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of 4 and 3 units respectively, and the manager aims to minimize these costs while adhering to these constraints. Given that the allocations for both X and Y must be integers due to the indivisible nature of the resources, calculate the minimum total cost required for this operation, rounded to the nearest whole number.
