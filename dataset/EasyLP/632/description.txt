A sports coach needs to allocate time for four different training sessions: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These sessions could be focusing on endurance, strength, agility and tactics respectively. The objective is to optimize the team's performance by minimizing the total fatigue score associated with these sessions which are 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 units per hour for session x1, x2, x3 and x4 respectively.\n\nThe schedule must adhere to the following constraints due to various limitations:\n- The combined hours of endurance and strength training (sessions x1 and x2) cannot exceed 20 hours a week.\n- The combined hours of agility and tactics training (sessions x3 and x4) cannot exceed 15 hours a week.\n- To achieve a balanced training program, the sum of endurance (session x1) hours and agility (session X3) hours must be at least 10.\n- Also, to ensure both strength building and strategic understanding are developed harmoniously; the sum of strength (session X2) hours and tactics (session X4) hours must be at least 8.\n\nGiven these conditions along with additional constraints that each type of session can have specific bounds on weekly allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total fatigue score for the team given optimal allocation within specified bounds rounded off to nearest whole number? Note that the allocations must be in whole numbers due to scheduling practicalities.
