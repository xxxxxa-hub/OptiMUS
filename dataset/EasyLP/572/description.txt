A military operation requires the allocation of resources across three different units: Unit X1, Unit X2, and Unit X3. The total number of resources that can be allocated is limited to 100 due to logistical constraints. Each unit has a cost associated with it, which is $50,000 for unit X1, $70,000 for unit X2, and $60,000 for unit X3. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting certain operational requirements.\n\nThe operational requirements are as follows:\n- The combined effect of half of the resources assigned to unit X1 plus six-tenths of those assigned to unit X3 should exceed or equal the effect created by seven-tenths of the resources assigned to unit X2 by at least 20 units.\n- Moreover, eight-tenths of the resources devoted to unit X2 and nine-tenths devoted to unit X3 should not surpass by more than 30 units what's been taken away from those dedicated to unit X1.\n\nAdditionally there are bounds on how much can be allocated: Between 10 and 50 units can be allocated for Unit x1; between 20 and 70 units for Unit x2; and between zero and 40 units for Unit x3. All allocations must be whole numbers due to nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nGiven these conditions, what would be minimum total cost in dollars required for this operation rounded off to nearest dollar?
