A marketing director is planning to allocate resources between three promotional channels (X, Y, and Z) for an upcoming product launch. The total resource across all three channels cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Channel X requires at least twice as many resources as channel Y to be effective, with a combined minimum of 200 units. Similarly, the allocation for channel Y and twice the allocation for channel Z should reach a minimum of 300 units.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource is $10 for channel X, $15 for channel Y, and $20 for channel Z. Given these conditions and that the number of resources allocated must be integers due to their indivisible nature, find the minimum total cost in dollars required to fulfill these requirements while minimizing the expenditure. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
