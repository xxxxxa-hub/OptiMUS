A healthcare administrator is planning the allocation of resources to four different services: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These could represent areas like emergency care, outpatient services, specialized treatment programs, and patient support services. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these services. Each unit of resource allocated to services x1, x2, x3, and x4 incurs costs of 0.5 , 0.2 , 3 , and 1.5 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary restrictions and service requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for services x1 and x2 cannot exceed 200 units.\n- The difference between 70% of the resources for service x1 and those for service x3 must be non-negative (i.e., greater than or equal to zero), reflecting a strategic emphasis on certain types of care.\n- Similarly, the difference between half of the resources for service x2 and those for service x4 should also be non-negative.\n- The combined resource allocation for services x3 and x4 must not exceed 180 units, considering available manpower or infrastructure capacity.\n\nMoreover, each service has specific bounds on resource allocation due to operational realities or regulatory compliance:\nx1 requires at least 50 but no more than 150 units; \nx2 needs a minimum of 80 up to a maximum of 120 units;\nx3 can utilize anywhere from 20 up to a limit of 70 units;\nand finally,x4 demands at least 30 but cannot exceed an upper limit of60 units.\n\nGiven these constraints as well as the requirement that all allocations are in whole numbers due to practical considerations such as staff hours or equipment availability,\nThe question is: What would be the minimum total cost incurred by optimal allocation across these four health services, rounded to the nearest whole number?
