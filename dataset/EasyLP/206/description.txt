In a healthcare scenario, a hospital manager is planning to allocate resources across three departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These departments could represent different specialties such as cardiology, neurology, and orthopedics respectively. The total allocation across all three departments cannot exceed 150 units due to budget constraints. Department $X$ requires at least 10 units more than department $Y$ due to its higher patient volume. On the other hand, department $Y$ can only receive at most 20 units more than department $Z$ to maintain service balance.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to departments $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as $\$100$, $\$50$, and $\$30$ respectively. The hospital aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to the allocation constraints for each department. Additionally, due to the nature of healthcare resources (such as staffing or equipment), allocations must be in whole numbers.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
