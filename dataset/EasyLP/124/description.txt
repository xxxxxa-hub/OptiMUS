An educational institution is planning to allocate resources for two programs: Program X and Program Y. Each program requires a certain number of resources to function properly, with the resource cost being 5 units for program X and 3 units for program Y. The institution aims to minimize the total resource expenditure.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints:- The combined allocation of twice the resources for Program X and four times the resources for Program Y should be at least 50 units, ensuring that both programs are sufficiently supported.- The allocation of thrice the resources for Program X plus those allocated for Program Y should not exceed 30 units, reflecting available resource limits.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total amount of resources required by this institution if it needs to meet these requirements while allocating only whole numbers of resources due to practicality? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
