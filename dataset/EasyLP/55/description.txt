A retail store manager is planning the inventory for two popular products, X and Y. The combined inventory of both products should not exceed 5000 units due to storage constraints. To meet customer demand, it is estimated that twice the number of units of product X plus thrice the number of units of product Y must be at least 3000. Additionally, in order to maintain a balanced inventory and prevent overstocking or understocking, five times the number of units of product X minus the number of units for product Y should not exceed 2000.\n\nEach unit of product X costs $20 and each unit of product Y costs $10. The manager aims to minimize total inventory cost while meeting all these constraints (with the quantities being whole numbers due to the nature of physical goods). What is the minimum total cost in dollars for maintaining this inventory, rounded to nearest dollar?
