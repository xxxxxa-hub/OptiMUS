An environmental organization is planning four projects, X1, X2, X3 and X4. These could involve activities like tree planting (X1), waste management (X2), water conservation (X3), and renewable energy promotion (X4). The objective is to minimize the total costs associated with these projects, which are 4 units for project X1, 2 units for project X2, 3 units for project X3 and 5 units for project X4.\n\nThe allocation of resources must meet certain constraints due to budget limitations and strategic priorities:\n- The difference between half the resources allocated to project X2 and those allocated to project X1 should not exceed 100 units.\n- The resources allocated to project X1 must be at least 200 units more than those allocated to 0.7 times the resources of project X3.\n- The difference between the resources allocated to Project x4 and those allocated to 0.6 times Project x2 should not exceed 150 units.\n- The difference between resources assigned to Project x3 multiplied by .8 times and Project x1 should not exceed 300 units.\n- Resources assigned to Project x4 should be at least by an amount of fifty more than that assigned for Project x2.\n\nGiven these constraints as well as the requirement that all allocations are in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources used in each project, also considering each resource has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nWhat would be the minimum total cost required for conducting all four projects within given bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
