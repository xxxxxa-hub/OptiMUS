A company manager needs to schedule employees for a particular task in three different shifts: morning (X), afternoon (Y), and night (Z). Due to the nature of the task, the total number of employees scheduled across all three shifts cannot exceed 24. The company policy requires at least 4 employees to be scheduled for the morning shift, at least 6 for the afternoon shift, and at least 5 for the night shift. Each employee's salary varies according to their shift: it costs $8 per hour for an employee on the morning shift, $6 per hour for an employee on the afternoon shift, and $5 per hour for an employee on the night shift. The manager aims to minimize labor cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that each shift is staffed with whole numbers of employees due to scheduling practicalities. What is the minimum total labor cost required for this operation? Please provide your answer in dollars rounded off to nearest whole number.
