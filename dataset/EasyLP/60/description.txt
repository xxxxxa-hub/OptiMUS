A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources between two projects: Project $X$ and Project $Y$. Each project requires different amounts of resources, with a resource unit for project $X$ costing $\$2000$ and for project $Y$, $\$3000$. The combined effort of these projects must meet certain performance targets. Specifically, the performance score calculated as 5 times the resources allocated to project X plus 10 times those allocated to project Y should be at least 50 points. Additionally, due to limited availability of a specific type of resources, the total usage calculated as 3 times the resources used by project X plus 4 times those used by project Y cannot exceed 40 units. If both X and Y are integers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. What is the minimum cost in dollars, rounded to nearest dollar that can be achieved while meeting all these conditions?
