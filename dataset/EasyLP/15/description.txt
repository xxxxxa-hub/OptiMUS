An energy company is planning the allocation of resources between two projects: X and Y. Both projects involve investments in different energy sources. The combined resource allocation for four times project X plus project Y cannot exceed 10 units due to budget constraints. To achieve a certain strategic objective, the sum of the resources allocated to project X and twice that for project Y must be at least 6 units.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects X and Y yields different returns or costs, quantified as 7 and 3 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all investments are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to nearest whole number?
