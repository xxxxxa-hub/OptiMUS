A tourism agency is planning to distribute its marketing budget among three popular destinations: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The goal is to attract as many tourists as possible while minimizing the total expenditure. The costs associated with advertising each destination are different, quantified as 10 units for $X$, 15 units for $Y$, and 20 units for $Z$ respectively.\n\nThe following constraints apply due to various factors such as budget limitations, seasonal popularity of the destinations, etc:- The combined investment in destination $X$ and destination $Y$ cannot exceed 100 units.- Similarly, the combined investment in destination $Y$ and destination $Z$ must not exceed 150 units.- To ensure a minimum level of visibility across all markets, the combined investments in destination $X$ and destination $Z$ should be at least 50 units.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of investment units (since fractional unit spending is not practical), find the minimum total cost required for this scenario. Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
