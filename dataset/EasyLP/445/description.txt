A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources between two projects: Project $X$ and Project $Y$. The total resource allocation for both projects combined cannot exceed 2000 units. To ensure a balanced development, the difference in resource allocation between twice that of Project $X$ and that of Project $Y$ must be at least 500 units. Additionally, the difference in resource allocation between that of Project $X$ and twice that of Project $Y$ should not exceed 1000 units. Due to certain constraints, the maximum resource allocation for project X is limited to 1500 units and for project Y it is limited to 1000 units. Each unit of resource allocated to Projects $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of \$5 and \$3 respectively. If the company aims to minimize the total cost while ensuring all these conditions are met with each unit being a whole number due to indivisible nature of resources, what would be the minimum total cost (in dollars), rounded to the nearest dollar?
