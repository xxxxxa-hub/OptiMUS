A retail company is planning to allocate its budget across three departments: X, Y, and Z. These departments could represent different aspects of the business such as procurement, marketing, and logistics respectively. The total budget across all three departments cannot exceed 1000 units due to financial constraints. Department X requires a minimum budget of 300 units for operation, while department Y needs at least 200 units. For department Z, a minimum of 500 units is required due to its larger scale or higher initial setup costs.\n\nEach unit of investment in departments X, Y, and Z yields different returns or costs: for every unit invested in department X it cost the company 10 units; investing in department Y cost the company 8 units per unit; and investing in department Z cost the company 6 units per unit.\n\nThe aim is to minimize the total expenditure while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all investments are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of monetary resources. Calculate the minimum total expenditure required for this scenario rounded off to the nearest whole number.
