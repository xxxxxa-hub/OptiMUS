A financial advisor is managing three different investment portfolios: X1, X2, and X3. The goal is to minimize the total risk associated with these portfolios, where risks are quantified as 2, 3, and 4 units for X1, X2, and X3 respectively. To ensure a diversified portfolio and meet client's financial objectives, the following conditions must be met:\n\n- The combined return from five times the investment in portfolio X1, seven times that in portfolio X2 and eight times that in portfolio X3 should be at least 1500 units.\n\n- The difference between the investment in portfolio X1 and three-quarters of that in portfolio X2 minus half of that in portfolio X3 should not exceed 200 units.\n\n- Moreover, twice the investment allocated to portfolio X2 minus those for portfolios X1 and X3 should exactly equal 400 units.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the requirement that all investments are whole numbers due to regulatory compliance issues,\nand each investment has specific bounds on allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total risk score for this investor given an optimal allocation of resources among these three portfolios within their specified bounds? Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.
