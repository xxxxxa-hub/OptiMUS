An environmental agency is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These projects could involve pollution control, habitat restoration, climate change research, and public education respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 2, 3, 4 and 5 units for each unit of resource allocated to x1, x2, x3 and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic considerations:\n- The combined resource allocation for projects x1 and x2 cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The sum of twice the allocation for project x3 and the allocation for project x4 must be at least 500 units.\n- The combined resource allocation for project x1 and thrice the allocation for project x4 cannot exceed 1200 units.\n- The difference between the resource allocations for projects x2 and twice that of project X3 should not exceed 300 units.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that all allocations must be whole numbers due to indivisibility of certain resources involved in each project: What is the minimum total cost (in arbitrary monetary unit) required by this agency under an optimal allocation plan? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
