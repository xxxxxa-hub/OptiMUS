In a human resources scenario, a company is planning to hire employees for two different positions: position $X$ and position $Y$. The objective is to minimize the total salary cost associated with these positions, with salaries being $\$5000$ per employee for position $X$ and $\$3000$ per employee for position $Y$. \n\nDue to budget constraints, the total number of hires cannot exceed 50. Furthermore, due to operational requirements, there must be at least 20 employees in position $X$, while the maximum number of employees that can be allocated to position $Y$ is 15. \n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of employees due to practicality, what is the minimum total salary cost for the company given these hiring restrictions? Provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar.
