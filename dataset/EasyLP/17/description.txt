In an energy optimization scenario, a company needs to allocate resources between two projects: $X$ and $Y$. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total investment across both projects must be at least 30 units due to minimum operational requirements. Additionally, the combined resource usage for these projects, calculated as 5 times the investment for project X plus 3 times the investment for project Y, should not exceed 150 units to meet sustainability goals. Each unit of investment in projects $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of 40 and 50 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints (note that investments in X and Y are integers due to the indivisible nature of resources). What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number?
