A marketing manager is planning the allocation of resources between three advertising campaigns: Campaign $X$, Campaign $Y$ and Campaign $Z$. The total budget for all campaigns combined is constrained to a maximum of 1000 units. However, there are minimum requirements for each campaign due to contractual obligations or strategic importance: Campaign $X$ requires at least 200 units, Campaign $Y$ needs at least 100 units, and Campaign $Z$ must have at least 50 units. Each unit of resource yields different returns or costs, quantified as 2 , 3 , and 4 units for Campaigns X, Y, and Z respectively. The marketing manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints and ensuring that the allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number?
