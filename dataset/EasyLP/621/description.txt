A supply chain manager needs to plan the allocation of resources among four processes: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These could represent different stages in a manufacturing process or different product lines. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these processes, with costs being 2, 3, 5, and 4 units for $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary restrictions and operational capacities:\n- The combined resource allocation for processes $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- Similarly, the combined resource allocation for processes $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 1200 units.\n- To maintain operational balance between stages, the allocation for process $x1$ should be at least as much as $\frac{4}{3}$ times that of process $x3$. \n- Similarly, the allocation for process $x2$ should be more than $\frac{9}{7}$ times that of process $x4$, by at least 200 units.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the requirement that allocations must be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources involved and specific bounds on resource allocation for each process:\nWhat is the minimum total cost incurred by optimal resource allocations across all four processes within their specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
