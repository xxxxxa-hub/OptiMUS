A military operation is planning to deploy four types of units: $X$, $Y$, $Z$ and $W$. The total number of type X and Y units that can be deployed is limited to 10 due to logistical constraints. Similarly, the total number of type Z and W units cannot exceed 20. To achieve a strategic objective, at least 5 units among X and Z should be deployed. In addition, at least 7 units among Y and W must also be deployed. Each unit of X, Y, Z and W requires support points worth $\$1000$, $\$2000$, $\$500$ and $\$1500$ respectively. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of units due to practical considerations, calculate the minimum total support points required for this operation if the military aims to minimize the total support points while adhering to these constraints.
