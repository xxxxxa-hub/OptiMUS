An educational institution needs to allocate funding across three departments: X, Y, and Z. These departments could represent Science, Arts, and Sports respectively. The total funding available is limited to 100 units due to budget constraints. Department X requires a minimum funding of 30 units to run its programs effectively, while department Y requires at least 20 units for its initiatives. Department Z needs a minimum of 10 units to maintain its operations. The cost per unit of effectiveness (such as student engagement or learning outcomes) for departments X, Y, and Z are 20, 15, and 10 respectively.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the total cost while meeting all the departmental funding requirements and ensuring that the allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost given these conditions? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
