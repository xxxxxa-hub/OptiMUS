A finance manager is planning the allocation of a total investment fund of \$100,000 across four different portfolios: $X$, $Y$, $Z$ and $W$. Each portfolio has an associated annual management fee rate. For portfolio $X$, the rate is 0.05, for portfolio $Y$ it's 0.07, for portfolio $Z$ it's 0.06 and for portfolio $W$ it's 0.09.\n\nTo ensure a balanced risk profile, there are certain minimum investment amounts set for each portfolio:- Portfolio X requires at least \$20,000- Portfolio Y requires at least \$15,000- Portfolio Z requires at least \$25,000- Portfolio W requires at least \$40,000\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total annual management fees while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that investments are made in whole dollars.\n\nWhat would be the minimum possible total annual management fee (in dollars), rounded to the nearest dollar?
