A marketing manager is planning to distribute a budget of $\$5000$ across four different advertising channels: TV ads, radio ads, online ads, and offline ads. The costs per unit of advertisement for these channels are $\$200$, $\$150$, $\$100$, and $\$50$, respectively. The manager must meet the following constraints due to various strategic considerations:\n\n- The difference in spending between TV ads and radio ads should be at least $\$1000$\n- The spending on online ads cannot exceed that on offline ads by more than $\$300$\n- At least \$1500 must be allocated to TV Ads\n\nMoreover, due to the nature of the advertising channels, the investments must be whole numbers.\n\nThe allocation also needs to consider specific bounds for each channel:\n- Spending on TV Ads can range from 0 up to a maximum of \$2500 \n- Radio Ads can have a minimum investment of 0 and a maximum of \$2000 \n- Online Ads require an investment ranging from 0 up to \$1200 \n- Offline Ads need at least \$800 with no upper limit defined.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this campaign when taking into account all constraints and aiming for optimal allocation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
