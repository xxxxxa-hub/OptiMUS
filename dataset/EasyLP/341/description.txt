A transportation company is planning to allocate resources across four different routes: x1, x2, x3, and x4. The cost associated with each route is given by the number of units multiplied by a factor - for routes x1, x2, x3 and x4 these factors are 5, 10, 7 and 8 respectively.\n\nThe resource allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to various operational requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for routes x1 and x2 cannot exceed 100 units.\n- Similarly, the combined allocation for routes x3 and x4 cannot exceed 200 units.\n- However, at least 50 units need to be allocated between routes x1 and x3 combined due to high demand on these routes.\n- Likewise, at least 80 units need to be allocated between routes x2 and x4 combined due to their strategic importance.\n\nAdditionally, each route has its own specific bounds on resource allocation:\nx1 can have anywhere from zero up to a maximum of 60 units;\nx2 can have zero up to a maximum of 50 units;\nx3 can range from zero up to a maximum of 150 units; \nx4 can range from zero up to a maximum of 90 units;\n\nGiven that all allocations should be in whole numbers due to practical limitations in splitting resources,\nThe question is: What is the minimum total cost for the company if it optimally allocates resources across these four routes within specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
