In a military logistics operation, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units, X and Y. The total number of units deployed must be at least 10 due to strategic requirements. However, the combined firepower score, calculated as 5 times the number of unit X plus 3 times the number of unit Y, cannot exceed 50 due to rules of engagement restrictions. Each unit of X and Y costs 1000 and 2000 support points respectively, and the commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the units. What is the minimum total support points required for this operation? Provide your answer in whole numbers.
