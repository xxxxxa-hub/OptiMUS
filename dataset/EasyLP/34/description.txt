A finance manager is planning the allocation of a total investment fund of $\$10,000$ between two potential investment opportunities: X and Y. The minimum amount that can be invested in opportunity $X$ is $\$2,000$, and for opportunity $Y$, it cannot be less than $\$3,000$. Each dollar invested in X and Y yields returns of $0.05\$ and $0.08\$$ respectively. Given these constraints, and considering that investments must be made in whole dollars (integer amounts), what is the minimum total return on investment in dollars the finance manager could expect from these allocations?
