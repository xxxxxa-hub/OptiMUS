A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources between two projects: X and Y. The projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure or implementing new technologies. Each unit of resource allocation to project X costs 4 units, while each unit allocated to project Y costs 5 units. The total resource allocation across both projects has a maximum limit of 100 units, with three times the allocation for project Y included in this calculation. To meet certain strategic objectives, the combined allocation of twice that for project X and that for project Y must be at least 50 units. Additionally, the difference between allocations for project X and Y should not exceed 20 units. Due to resource limitations, the allocation for Project X can't exceed 60 units while that for Project Y can't exceed 30 units.\n\nThe aim is to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring all allocations are in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost given optimal resource allocation within these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
