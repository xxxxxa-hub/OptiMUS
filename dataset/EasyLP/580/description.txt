A real estate developer is planning to allocate resources across three types of projects: residential ($X$), commercial ($Y$), and industrial ($Z$). The total resources that can be allocated cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. For strategic reasons, the resource allocation for residential projects must exceed that of commercial projects by at least 50 units. Furthermore, the difference between resources allocated to industrial and residential projects should not be more than 200 units. Lastly, the resource allocation for commercial projects must be at least 30 units more than that of industrial ones.\n\nEach unit of investment in residential, commercial, and industrial development incurs different costs - $200$, $150$, and $300$ respectively. Given these conditions, and considering that all investments are in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources being allocated, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
