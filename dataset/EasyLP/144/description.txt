A military commander is planning to allocate resources between two types of units, X and Y. Each unit of X and Y requires 5000 and 3000 support points respectively. The total number of units that can be allocated must be at least 50 to meet operational requirements. Furthermore, due to the limitations in logistics, the combined strength calculated as 5 times the unit of X plus 3 times the unit of Y cannot exceed 200. Considering these constraints, find the minimum total support points required if both X and Y are integers.
