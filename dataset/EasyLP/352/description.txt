In a healthcare scenario, a hospital administrator needs to allocate resources across four departments: $X, Y, Z$, and $W$. These could represent different areas such as General Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, and Geriatrics. The total resource allocation between departments $X$ and $Y$ cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. Similarly, the combined resource allocation for departments $Z$ and $W$ is limited to 80 units.\n\nTo maintain a balanced service provision across all areas of care, the sum of resources allocated to departments $X$ and $Z$ must be at least 50 units. Similarly, the combined resource allocation for departments $Y$ and $W$ must be at least 60 units.\n\nThe costs associated with each unit of resource in these departments are different due to varying requirements and complexities. Specifically, they are 0.2 for department X, 0.3 for department Y, 0.1 for department Z ,and 0.4 for department W respectively.\n\nThe hospital aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints considering that allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of resources being allocated (e.g., full-time staff). What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded up to the nearest whole number.
