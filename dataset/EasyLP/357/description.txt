A retail manager is planning the inventory for four different types of products: x1, x2, x3, and x4. The costs per unit are \$1.5 for product x1, \$2 for product x2, \$3 for product x3, and \$4 for product x4 respectively.\n\nThe following constraints must be met due to storage capacity and demand forecasts:- The combined units of products x1 and x2 cannot exceed 500.- The combined units of products x3 and x4 cannot exceed 300.- The total units of products from categories (x1 + x3) must be at least 200 to meet customer demands.- Similarly, the total units of products from categories (x2 + x4) must be at least 100.\n\nAdditionally, each type of product has its own storage restrictions:Product X1 can have between 0 and 250 units in stock;Product X2 can have between 0 and 250 units in stock;Product X3 can have between 0 and 150 units in stock; and Product X4 can also have between 0 and 150 units in stock.\n\nConsidering that the number of products ordered should be a whole number as items cannot be divided,What is the minimum total cost in dollars for stocking these items given these constraints? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.
