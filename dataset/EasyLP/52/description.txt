A retail manager needs to decide how many units of two products, $X$ and $Y$, to order for the upcoming sales season. The unit cost for product $X$ is $\$2$ and for product $Y$ is $\$3$. The total number of units that can be ordered due to storage constraints is limited to 1000. To ensure a balanced inventory, at least 200 units of product $X$ and at least 300 units of product $Y$ must be ordered. Both $X$ and $Y$ are sold in integer quantities. What is the minimum total cost for ordering these products under these conditions? Please give your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
