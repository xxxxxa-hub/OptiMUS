A transportation company is planning to distribute its fleet of vehicles across four different routes: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These routes have varying operational costs associated with them, which are 5, 4, 6 and 7 units for routes x1, x2, x3 and x4 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total operational cost while ensuring that the service demands for each route are met.\n\nThe distribution of the fleet must adhere to the following constraints due to traffic regulations and capacity limitations:\n- The combined number of vehicles on routes x1 and x2 cannot exceed 20.\n- Similarly, the combined number of vehicles on routes x3 and x4 cannot exceed 30.\n- To ensure sufficient coverage in certain areas, at least a total of 15 vehicles should be assigned to routes x1 and x3.\n- At least a total of 10 vehicles should be assigned to routes x2 and x4.\n\nAdditionally, due to fleet size restrictions:\n- Route X1 can accommodate between 0 and 50 vehicles (inclusive).\n- Route X2 can accommodate between 0 and 40 vehicles (inclusive).\n- Route X3 can accommodate between 0 and 60 vehicles (inclusive).\n- Route X4 can accommodate between 0 and 70 vehicles (inclusive).\nThe allocation must also be in whole numbers as you cannot assign a fraction of a vehicle. \n\nWhat is the minimum total operational cost for the company if it distributes its fleet optimally among these four routes? Give your answer rounded to the nearest whole unit.
