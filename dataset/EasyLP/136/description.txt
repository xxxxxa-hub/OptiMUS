An environmental organization is planning to allocate funds between two projects, X and Y. The total allocation for both projects combined cannot exceed 200 units due to budget constraints. Moreover, the sum of allocations for project X and Y must be at least 50 units to ensure that each project receives sufficient funding. For every unit of funding allocated, the cost associated with project $X$ is 5 units and with project $Y$ it's 8 units. The organization aims to minimize the total cost while ensuring all conditions are met and that allocations are whole numbers due to administrative reasons. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number.
