An energy company is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total investment across all three projects cannot exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum investment of 2000 units more than negative three times the investment in project $Y$ to be viable, while project $Z$ requires at least 1000 units more than the investment in project $Y$, possibly due to its larger scale or higher initial setup costs. Each unit of investment in projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ yields different returns or costs, quantified as 20 , 15 , and 30 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to the constraints for each project (X, Y, Z are integers). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number.
