An environmental agency is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These projects could involve restoring habitats, cleaning polluted areas, implementing renewable energy systems, and educating the public about environmental issues, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being $\$10$, $\$20$, $\$30$, and $\$40$ per unit for $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations, manpower availability, and project requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for projects $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 100 units.\n- The combined resource allocation for projects $x3$ and $x4$ must be at least 50 units.\n- The sum of twice the allocation for project x1 plus three times the allocation for project x2 minus the allocation for project x3 must not exceed zero units.\n- A specific balance between the allocations of these projects must be maintained such that subtracting twice the resources allocated to project x2 from four times those allocated to project x3 equals five times those allocated to project x4. \n\nGiven that each unit of resource is indivisible (i.e., allocations should be whole numbers) and there are upper bounds on how much can be assigned to each project:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars for this environmental agency given optimal resource distribution across all four projects (rounded up to nearest dollar)?
