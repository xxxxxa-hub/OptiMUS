A retail manager is planning the allocation of budget between three departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different categories of products or various areas within the store. The total budget across all three departments cannot exceed $\$5000$ due to overall company constraints. Each unit of budget in departments X, Y, and Z costs $\$10$, $\$20$, and $\$30$, respectively.\n\nThe manager also has specific requirements for each department:- The combined effectiveness (measured by sales revenue) generated by 5 units of investment in department X and 10 units in department Y must be at least $\$10000$.- The difference in budget between department X and department Z should not exceed $\$1500$. This could be due to a strategic decision to maintain a balance between these two departments.\n\nGiven these conditions, the manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints. Considering that budgets can only be allocated in whole dollars due to accounting standards, what is the minimum total cost needed for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
