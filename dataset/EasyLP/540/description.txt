A construction company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: X1, X2, and X3. These projects could involve building residential houses, commercial buildings, and infrastructural facilities respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$500, \$700, and \$900 for each unit of resource allocated to project X1, X2, and X3 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limits and manpower considerations:\n- The combined resource allocation for all three projects cannot exceed 10 units.\n- Five times the allocation for project X1 combined with four times that for project X2 must be at least 30 units.\n- The difference between seven times the allocation for project X1 and six times that for project X3 must not exceed 20 units.\n- The difference in resource allocations between project X2 and the sum of allocations for projects X1 and X3 should be non-negative (i.e., it should either be zero or a positive number).\n\nGiven these constraints along with the objective function, while also ensuring that the allocations are whole numbers due to indivisibility of resources used (like manpower hours), find out what would be minimum total cost? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
