A construction manager is planning the allocation of resources across three types of tasks: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These tasks could represent different phases in a construction project such as foundation laying (task X), structure building (task Y), and interior finishing (task Z). The total number of man-hours allocated across all three tasks cannot exceed 50 due to labor constraints. In order to ensure the quality and timely completion of the project, it is necessary that the combined effort calculated as thrice the man-hours for task X plus four times the man-hours for task Y plus single man-hour for task Z must be at least 100. Additionally, another measure computed as twice the man-hours for task X minus those for task Y plus those for task Z should not exceed 75. Each hour of work on tasks $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs of $100 , 200 , and 150 units respectively. The company aims to minimize these costs while adhering to all project constraints and ensuring that all allocations are whole numbers due to practicality in scheduling manpower. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar.
