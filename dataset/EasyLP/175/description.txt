An energy company is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could involve investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total investment across project X and Y cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. To ensure a balanced portfolio, the sum of investments in project X and Z must be at least 150 units. Similarly, the combined investment in project Y and Z cannot exceed 200 units. Each unit of investment in projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ yields different returns or costs, quantified as 3 , 4 , and 5 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total investment cost while adhering to these constraints for each project (where X,Y,Z are integers). Calculate the minimum total investment cost required for this scenario.
