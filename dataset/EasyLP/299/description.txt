An environmental organization is planning to allocate funds to three different projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These projects could involve clean water initiatives, reforestation efforts, and renewable energy investments, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 5 units for project $X$, 2 units for project $Y$, and 3 units for project $Z$.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary restrictions and strategic priorities:- The combined resource allocation for all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units.- The allocation for project $X$ minus that of project $Y$ must be at least 10 units, reflecting a priority towards clean water initiatives.- The allocation for project $Z$ minus that of project $Y$ should not exceed 20 units, ensuring balanced resource distribution.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that the allocations for projects X,Y,Z must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources:\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario given an optimal allocation strategy among these three projects? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
