In a sports training center, the management needs to schedule training hours for four groups: X, Y, Z and W. The time slots are discrete and cannot be broken down into smaller intervals. Therefore, the number of allocated time slots must be integers. Each group has different requirements in terms of skill development that result in different fatigue scores per hour of training: 2 for group X, 3 for group Y, 4 for group Z and 5 for group W.\n\nThe following constraints apply due to availability of facilities and trainers:\n- The combined training hours of groups X and Y cannot exceed 10 hours.\n- The combined training hours of groups Z and W cannot exceed 12 hours.\n- To ensure a balanced program, the sum of training hours for groups X and Z must be at least 6.\n- Similarly, the sum of training hours for groups Y and W must be at least 8.\n\nMoreover, each group has specific limits on how many hours they can train:\n- Group X can train between 0 to 5 hours,\n- Group Y can train between 0 to 5 hours,\n- Group Z can train between 0 to 6 hours,\n- Group W can train between 0 to 6 hours.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total fatigue score that meets all these constraints when allocating the optimal number of training hours among the four groups (X,Y,Z,W)? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
