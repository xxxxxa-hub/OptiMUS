A real estate developer is planning to build two types of properties: luxury villas (X) and apartments (Y). The number of each type of property that can be built is limited due to zoning restrictions and available land. Specifically, the total number of properties cannot exceed 100, and the numbers of villas and apartments must fall within the ranges [30,70] and [20,80], respectively. Each villa costs \$5000 to build while each apartment costs \$3000. Given these constraints, what is the minimum possible total construction cost in dollars if all properties are built as integers?
