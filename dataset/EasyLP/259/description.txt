In a supply chain optimization scenario, a company needs to allocate resources across three different distribution centers: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost associated with these centers, with costs being 5, 6, and 3 units for $X, Y$, and $Z$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to capacity limitations:- The combined resource allocation for center X and center Y cannot exceed 1000 units.- The combined resource allocation for center Y and center Z cannot exceed 1200 units.- The difference in resource allocation between center X and center Z must be at least 200 units.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that the allocations for $X, Y$, and $Z$ must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources. Each distribution center has specific bounds on resource allocation: Center X can hold from 0 up to 700 units; Center Y can hold from 0 up to 500 units; Center Z can hold from 0 up to 600 units. \nWhat is the minimum total transportation cost for this supply chain scenario given an optimal allocation of resources across all three centers within their respective bounds? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
