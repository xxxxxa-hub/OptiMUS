In a military logistics scenario, a commander needs to allocate resources across four types of units: $X1, X2, X3$, and $X4$. These units could represent different kinds of troops or equipment. The commander has the following constraints on resource allocation due to logistical and strategic considerations:- The total number of units for $X1$ and $X2$ must be at least 100.- Twice the number of units for $X2$ plus thrice the number for $X3$ cannot exceed 250.- The difference in units between unit type $X4$ and unit type $X1$ should be at least 50.- The difference in units between unit type $X3$ and twice the number of unit type $X4$ should not exceed -30.Additionally, there are upper limits on each type of resource due to availability constraints: - The maximum available units for troop/equipment types are as follows: $\leq200$ for type X1, $\leq150$ for X2, $\leq120$ for X3, and $\leq90$ for X4.The cost per unit (in terms of supply points) associated with each type is as follows: 5000 points/unit for $X1$, 4000 points/unit for $X2$, 6000 points/unit for $X3$, and 7000 points/unit for $X4$. Given that all allocations need to be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of troops/equipment:What is the minimum total cost in supply points required by the commander to satisfy these constraints? Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.
