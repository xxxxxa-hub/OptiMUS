A transportation manager needs to distribute resources between three different routes: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These routes could represent shipments of goods to different regions. The total resources that can be allocated across all three routes cannot exceed 2000 units due to constraints on vehicle availability. Route $X$ requires at least a 1000 unit difference in resource allocation compared to twice the allocation for route $Y$, possibly due to its longer distance or heavier traffic. Similarly, the difference in resource allocation between route $Z$ and route $Y$ must be at least 500 units, possibly due to different demand levels.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of resource allocated is 3 for route X, 2 for route Y, and 1 for route Z. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this distribution plan, rounded to the nearest whole number?
