A real estate developer is planning to build houses and apartments on a plot of land. Each house (represented by $x$) requires an investment of \$400,000, while each apartment (represented by $y$) requires an investment of \$600,000. The developer wants to ensure that the total number of houses and apartments built should generate a minimum combined value (1.5 times the number of houses plus twice the number of apartments) of at least 500 units due to market demands. However, due to construction capacity limitations, they also need to make sure that the total work load does not exceed 300 units (0.75 times the number of houses plus the number of apartments). Given these constraints and aiming for whole numbers of buildings due to practicalities in construction, what is the minimum total investment required for this project? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
