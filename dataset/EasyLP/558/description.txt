A tourism company is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent different aspects of the business such as infrastructure development, marketing campaigns, and staff training. The total allocation across all three projects cannot exceed 500 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 100 units to be viable, while project $Y$ needs at least 50 units, and project $Z$ requires at least 20 units. Each unit of allocation in projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs of 40 , 60 , and 100 units respectively.\n\nThe company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. Furthermore, each project has specific upper bounds on resource allocation; they are 300 for X, 200 for Y, and 100 for Z.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario given these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
