A real estate investor is planning to invest in four types of properties: residential (x1), commercial (x2), industrial (x3), and recreational (x4). The cost associated with each type of property per unit is \$5, \$7, \$3, and \$4 respectively. The objective is to minimize the total investment cost while adhering to several constraints:- The combined investment in all four types of properties cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints.- To maintain a diversified portfolio, the sum of investments in residential properties plus four times the investments in commercial properties plus the investments in industrial properties plus twice the investments in recreational properties must be at least 50 units.- For specific market reasons, three times the investment in residential properties plus once the investment in commercial properties plus twice the investment in industrial properties plus once the investment in recreational properties must equal exactly 75 units.In addition, each type of property has a maximum limit on how much can be invested:- Residential Properties: Up to 40 units- Commercial Properties: Up to 50 units- Industrial Properties: Up to 30 units- Recreational Properties: Up to 20 unitsNote that due to certain regulations and restrictions, investments should be made only in whole numbers.What would be the minimum total cost for this investor given these conditions? Please provide your answer rounded down to nearest dollar.
