A marketing manager has to distribute resources between four channels for a new campaign. The resources allocated to each channel must be in whole numbers due to the nature of the resources. The total amount of resource that can be assigned to channel $x1$ and $x2$ is limited to 1000 units, while the combined allocation for twice of $x3$ and thrice of $x4$ cannot exceed 1500 units. There are additional constraints as well: the allocation for $x1$ should exceed half of that for $x3$ by at least 300 units; and, the difference between allocations for $x4$ and $x2$ should not surpass 400 units.\n\nEach unit of resource invested in channels $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$ incurs different costs, quantified as 50, 60, 30, and 20 units respectively. Furthermore, each channel has specific bounds on resource allocation: up to a maximum of 800 units can be allocated to channel $x1$, up to a maximum of 700 units can be allocated to channel $x2$, up to a maximum of 500 units can be allocated to channel $x3$, and up to a maximum of 200 units can be allocated to channel $x4$. \n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers in resource allocation due its indivisible nature, what is the minimum total cost required given these optimal distribution among all four channels (rounded off)?
