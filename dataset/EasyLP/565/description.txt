An environmental organization is planning to allocate resources across three initiatives: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These initiatives could represent different conservation projects, like wildlife protection ($X$), forest preservation ($Y$), and ocean cleanup ($Z$). The total resources available for all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. The project $X$ requires at least 100 units more than twice the allocation of project $Y$, reflecting its higher urgency or potential impact. The difference between the resources allocated to project $Y$ and project $Z$ should not exceed 50 units to ensure a balanced approach towards both terrestrial and marine environments. Moreover, the combined resources allocated to project $X$ and project $Z$ must be at least 300 units, indicating a minimum commitment towards wildlife protection and ocean cleanup.\n\nThe costs associated with each unit of resource allocation are 2 for initiative X, 3 for Y, and 4 for Z. Each initiative also has specific bounds on resource allocation due to operational limits or strategic considerations.\n\nGiven these conditions, the organization aims to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of some resources. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
