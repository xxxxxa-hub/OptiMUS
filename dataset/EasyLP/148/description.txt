A shipping company operates two types of cargo ships, X and Y. Each ship type has different capacities and costs associated with it. The company needs to decide how many of each type of ship to operate in order to meet a demand for transporting at least 50 units of goods. Specifically, one unit of good can be transported by either one ship X or one ship Y. However, due to fuel consumption and maintenance requirements, the combined operation of 2 ships X and one ship Y cannot exceed 120 units.\n\nOperating a ship X costs 7 units while operating a ship Y costs 5 units. Both types of ships must be operated in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the ships.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost for operating the ships to meet the demand for goods transportation while adhering to operational constraints? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
