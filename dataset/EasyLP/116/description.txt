A tourism company is planning to allocate resources between two types of tour packages: X and Y. The total number of tour packages sold cannot exceed 100 due to capacity limitations. To maintain a diverse portfolio, the number of X packages sold must be at least 10 more than twice the number of Y packages. Additionally, the difference in the number of Y packages and half the number of X packages should not exceed 20 to ensure both types are adequately represented. Selling each package incurs different costs: \$50 for package X and \$80 for package Y. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints, with sales numbers rounded down to whole numbers as partial sales are not possible. Given that there are upper bounds on how many each type can be sold (X up to 70, Y up to 50), what is the minimum total cost?
