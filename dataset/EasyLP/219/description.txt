A retail store manager needs to stock up three categories of products: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total number of items that can be stored is limited to 500 due to space constraints. Each category requires a minimum amount of items to be stocked: Category $X$ requires at least 100 items, category $Y$ needs at least 80 items, and category $Z$ must have at least 120 items. The cost per item for each category is different - it's $\$5$ for an item in category $X$, $\$4$ for an item in category $Y$, and $\$6$ for an item in category $Z$. Given these constraints and costs, the manager wants to determine how many items from each category should be stocked so as to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all quantities are whole numbers (since fractional items cannot exist). What is the minimum possible total cost, rounded to the nearest dollar?
