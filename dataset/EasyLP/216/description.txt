A retail store manager is planning to allocate resources among three departments: X, Y, and Z. These could represent different sections of the store such as electronics, clothing, and groceries respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these departments. Each unit of resource allocated to departments X, Y, and Z incurs a cost of 5 units, 3 units, and 2 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must satisfy the following constraints due to available resources and department needs:\n- The combined resource allocation for departments X and Y cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- Similarly, the combined resource allocation for departments Y and Z cannot exceed 800 units.\n- To ensure balance across the store's offerings, the combined resources for departments X and Z must be at least 500 units.\n\nGiven that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources: What is the minimum total cost incurred by allocating resources optimally among these three departments (X,Y,Z), rounded off to nearest whole number?
