A school district is planning to allocate funds across three programs: X, Y, and Z. These programs could represent investments in technology upgrades, teacher training, and student resources respectively. The total funding across all three programs cannot exceed $1000 due to budget constraints. Additionally, the combined funding for twice program X and program Y must be at least $400 to meet specific educational objectives. Similarly, the sum of the funding for program Y and Z should be at least $500 to ensure sufficient investment in these areas.\n\nEach dollar of investment in programs X, Y, and Z yields different benefits quantified as 5 , 3 , and 1 units respectively. The school district aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to the investment constraints for each program. Also note that all investments are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of monetary resources.\n\nGiven these conditions along with bounds on resource allocation (0-600 for X, 0-400 for Y and 0-300 for Z), what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
