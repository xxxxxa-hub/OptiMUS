In a sports training program, a coach needs to allocate hours between three types of exercises for the athletes: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different areas of focus such as strength training, endurance training, and flexibility training. The total time spent on all three types of exercises should be at least 10 hours. However, due to specific training requirements, the time difference between exercise X and Y should not exceed 4 hours and between Y and Z should not exceed 5 hours. Each hour spent on X, Y, Z will result in a fatigue score of 2, 3, and 1 respectively.\n\nGiven that each type of exercise has an upper limit on the number of hours that can be allocated (15 for X, 20 for Y, and 25 for Z), the coach wants to minimize the total fatigue score while ensuring that these constraints are met. Also note that it's only practical to assign whole number hours to each exercise type.\n\nWhat is the minimum total fatigue score possible given these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
