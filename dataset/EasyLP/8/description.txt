A marketing manager is planning the distribution of advertising budget between two advertising channels, Ad1 and Ad2 for an upcoming campaign. The total effort from both channels combined must yield a minimum effectiveness score of at least 50 points. Additionally, to prevent audience fatigue, the combined effort of these channels calculated as 4 times the budget for Ad1 plus 6 times the budget for Ad2 should not exceed 300 points. Given that the cost per unit of effectiveness for Ad1 is \$5 and for Ad2 is \$3 and considering that budgets can only be allocated in whole dollars (Ad1, Ad2 are integers), find the minimum total cost in dollars required to meet all constraints while achieving the objectives.
