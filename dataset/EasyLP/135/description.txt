An environmental organization is planning to invest in two projects: Project X which involves tree planting, and Project Y which focuses on waste management. The investment in each project must be a whole number due to the indivisible nature of resources. The total combined investment for both projects cannot exceed 20 units due to budget limitations. Additionally, the overall environmental impact score, calculated as twice the investment in Project X plus the investment in Project Y, should be at least 10 points to meet their objectives.\n\nEach unit of investment in Projects X and Y has an associated cost of 4 and 5 units respectively, and the organization aims to minimize this total cost while meeting all constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
