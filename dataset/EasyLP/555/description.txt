In a sports training scenario, a coach needs to allocate weekly training hours among three groups: strength conditioning (X), skill development (Y), and strategy & tactics (Z). Each group must have whole numbers of training hours due to scheduling practicalities. The total number of training hours for all three groups combined is constrained to a maximum of 1000 hours. Group X requires at least 200 hours, while group Y needs at least 150 hours, and group Z requires no less than 250 hours. The fatigue scores associated with each hour of training are 2 for group X, 3 for group Y, and 4 for group Z respectively. The coach aims to minimize the total fatigue score while meeting all these constraints. What would be the minimum total fatigue score rounded to the nearest whole number?
