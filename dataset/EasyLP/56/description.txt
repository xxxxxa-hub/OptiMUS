A retail store manager is planning to allocate shelf space for two types of products: X and Y. The total shelf space available is limited to 2000 units. To meet consumer demand, the combined shelf space of twice the amount for product X and product Y must be at least 500 units. Additionally, the difference in shelf space between product X and twice the amount for product Y cannot exceed 1000 units, ensuring a balanced product display.\n\nThe cost associated with each unit of shelf space is $2 for product X and $3 for product Y. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the allocated shelf spaces are integers due to practical considerations.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost in dollars required under this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar.
