A sports coach is planning to allocate weekly training hours among four different groups: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These groups could represent skill development, strength conditioning, strategy training, and recovery sessions respectively. The objective is to minimize the total fatigue score associated with these trainings which are calculated as 10 for group x1, 15 for group x2, 12 for group x3 and 20 for group x4.\n\nThe coach has set the following constraints due to schedule limitations:- The combined training hours of skill development (group x1) and strength conditioning (group x2) should not exceed 8 hours.- The combined hours of strategy training (group x3) and recovery sessions (group x4) cannot be more than 10 hours.- To maintain a balanced schedule between different types of training, the sum of skill development (x1) and strategy training(x3) should be at least 5 hours.- Similarly,the combined time spent on strength conditioning (x2) and recovery sessions(x4), must be at least 6 hours.\n\nEach group also has specific bounds on the amount of weekly practice they can handle.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that each session requires whole numbers of training hours due to practicality issues,\nWhat is the minimum possible fatigue score under this optimal allocation plan? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
