A retail manager is planning to allocate resources to four different categories of products: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These categories could involve clothing, electronics, groceries, and home appliances respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these categories which are 2, 3, 4, and 5 units for x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limits and storage capacity:- The combined resource allocation for clothing (x1) and electronics (x2) cannot exceed 100 units.- The allocation for twice the clothing category (x1) plus groceries category (x3) must be at least 50 units.- The allocation for electronics category(x2) minus three times home appliances category (x4), should not exceed 20 units.- Allocation of home appliances category(x4) minus half of clothing category(x1) should be at least 10 units.\n\nGiven these constraints and the objective function along with requirement that allocations for all product categories(x1,x2,x3,and x4) must be whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources in a retail scenario:\nWhat is the minimum total cost that can be achieved by optimally allocating resources within specified bounds(rounded to nearest whole number)?
