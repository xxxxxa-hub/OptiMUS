In a scheduling scenario, a company needs to allocate working hours between three teams: $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$. These could represent different shifts or different types of work. The total working hours for each team are constrained as follows: Team $X1$ can work between 0 to 24 hours, Team $X2$ can work between 0 to 12 hours, and Team $X3$ can work between 0 to 30 hours. Each hour of work for the teams costs the company differently, with costs being 5 units for team $X1$, 6 units for team $X2$, and 3 units for team $X3$. \n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following operational constraints:- The combined effort of twice the hours worked by Team X1 plus thrice the hours worked by Team X2 plus the hours worked by Team X3 must be at least equal to ten.- The combined effort of four times the hours worked by Team X1 plus five times the hours worked by Team X2 plus twice the hours worked by Team X3 cannot exceed twenty.- The difference in effort measured as one time of hour worked by Teams X1 and X3 minus two times that of team X2 should be at least eight.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of working hours due to practicalities (Teams cannot work fractional shifts), what is the minimum total cost for the company given these constraints on scheduling? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
