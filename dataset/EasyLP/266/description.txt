A human resources manager is planning the allocation of a hundred new employees across three departments: X, Y, and Z. These departments could represent sales, marketing, and operations respectively. Department X requires at least 20 new hires to meet its operational needs, while department Y needs a minimum of 15 new hires for its expansion plans. Department Z also requires at least 10 new hires to maintain service quality.\n\nEach new hire in departments X, Y and Z incurs different training costs which are $50, $80 and $30 respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost of training while meeting the staffing requirements of each department. Given that each department must receive whole numbers of new hires due to the nature of hiring people,\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost for training these employees across all three departments under these conditions? Provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole number.
