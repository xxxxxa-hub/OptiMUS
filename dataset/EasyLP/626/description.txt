A Human Resources (HR) manager is planning to allocate the department's annual budget across four different initiatives: X1, X2, X3, and X4. These initiatives could involve employee training programs, wellness activities, technology upgrades and diversity and inclusion efforts respectively. The HR manager aims to minimize the total cost associated with these initiatives while ensuring they meet certain strategic objectives.\n\nThe following constraints apply due to the financial limitations and operational needs of the department:\n- The combined allocation for initiatives X1 and X2 cannot exceed 50 units due to resource limitations.\n- Similarly, the combined allocation for initiatives X3 and X4 should not be more than 70 units considering their relatively higher implementation costs.\n- To ensure a balanced approach in all areas of HR management, the difference between initiative X1 and twice that of initiative X3 must be at least 10 units.\n- In addition, no more than double the resources allocated to initiative X4 can be subtracted from those for initiative X2 without exceeding a limit of 20 units.\n\nEach unit allocated towards initiatives X1, X2, X3 and X4 incurs costs of \$5000, \$6000, \$7000 and \$8000 respectively. Each initiative has specific bounds on resource allocation as stated in the problem description above. Given these constraints along with the requirement that allocations must be whole numbers due to budgetary considerations,\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost (in dollars) required by this HR department given an optimal allocation of resources among these four initiatives? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest dollar.
