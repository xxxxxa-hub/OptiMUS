A sports coach is planning the training schedule for three groups within the team: group $X$ focuses on strength conditioning, group $Y$ on skill development, and group $Z$ on strategy and tactics. The objective is to optimize the team's performance by minimizing the total fatigue score, which is affected by the training intensity and duration for each group. The fatigue scores associated with each hour of training are 10 for group X, 15 for group Y, and 5 for group Z.\n\nThe coach has established some constraints for their weekly training schedule: - The combined hours of strength conditioning (group X) and skill development (group Y) must be at least 8 hours to ensure a balanced training program.- To prevent over-training, the sum of skill development (group Y) hours and strategy and tactics (group Z) hours must not exceed 20.- Additionally, strength conditioning (group X) should always have at least three more hours than strategy and tactics(group Z).\n\nConsidering these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of training hours due to scheduling practicalities along with specific bounds on training time allocated to each group:\n What is the minimum total fatigue score for the team given an optimal allocation of weekly training hours among groups X,Y,Z? Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.
