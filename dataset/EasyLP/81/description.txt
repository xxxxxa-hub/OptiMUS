A construction company is planning to allocate resources between two projects, X and Y. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the resources. They have the following constraints:- The combined resource allocation for twice of project X and thrice of project Y must be at least 200 units, reflecting specific project requirements.- The allocation for four times project X plus project Y cannot exceed 300 units, ensuring balanced resource distribution.- Project X's resource allocation must not be less than that of Project Y.Additionally, there are specific bounds on resource allocation: Project X can receive a maximum of 100 units and Project Y can receive up to 80 units.\nEach unit allocated to projects X and Y incurs costs of \$500 and \$600 respectively. Calculate the minimum total cost required in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar.
