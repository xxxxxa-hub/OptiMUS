A scheduler in a manufacturing company is planning to allocate hours to four different tasks: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These tasks could involve machine maintenance, staff training, production and quality control respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these tasks, with costs being 6, 7, 5 and 4 units for x1, x2, x3 and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to labor availability and production requirements:\n- The combined hours allocated for task x1 and task x2 cannot exceed 8.\n- The hours spent on task x3 should be at least three more than those spent on task x4.\n- The sum of the hours for task x1 plus half of the hours allocated for task X2 minus those assigned to task X3 should not exceed six.\n- Half of the time dedicated to task X2 plus that allocated for Task X4 minus that assigned for Task X1 should be at least zero.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that all allocations must be integers due to work hour practicalities,\nWhat is the minimum total cost required given optimal scheduling within specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
