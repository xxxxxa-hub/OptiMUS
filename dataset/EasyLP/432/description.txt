A financial manager needs to allocate funds between two investment options, X and Y. Both options have different expected returns and risks associated with them, represented by a cost score. The cost score per unit of investment is 7 for option X and 9 for option Y. The goal is to minimize the total cost while meeting certain constraints.\n\nThe combined cost score from four times the investment in option X plus five times that in option Y should not exceed 1000 units, reflecting risk tolerance levels. To achieve a balanced portfolio, the difference between three times the investment in option X and twice that in option Y must be at least 200 units. Furthermore, due to limited resources, the total combined investment in both options cannot exceed 300 units.\n\nEach unit of allocation represents a specific amount of money or resource (such as time or manpower), which can't be divided further; thus, investments in both options must be whole numbers.\n\nConsidering these conditions and aiming for integer values of investments due to practical considerations (the indivisible nature of certain resources), what is the minimum total cost score possible? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
