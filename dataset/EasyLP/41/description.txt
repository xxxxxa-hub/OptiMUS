A financial advisor is planning the allocation of a client's portfolio between two investment options: option $X$ and option $Y$. Due to the nature of these investments, any allocations must be whole numbers. The total amount invested in both options combined cannot exceed \$10,000 due to the client's budget constraints. Furthermore, for diversification purposes, at least \$2,000 must be allocated to option $X$, and at least \$3,000 must be allocated to option $Y$. The cost per unit of return for investment option $X$ is \$0.02 and for investment option $Y$ it is \$0.03. If the financial advisor aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that allocations are integers, what would be the minimum total cost in dollars (rounded to the nearest dollar)?
