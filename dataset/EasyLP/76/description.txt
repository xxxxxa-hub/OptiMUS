A construction company is planning to allocate resources between two types of projects: X and Y. The total number of projects that can be handled is limited to 50 due to resource constraints. To maintain a diverse portfolio, the combined number of twice the projects of type X and projects of type Y must be at least 30. Additionally, the difference in numbers between project X and project Y should not exceed 10 to ensure balanced allocation. Each project of type X and Y requires \$2000 and \$3000 respectively, and the company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints, ensuring that the number of projects for both X and Y are integers within their respective bounds (X has a maximum limit of 40 while Y has a maximum limit of 20). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this operation in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar.
