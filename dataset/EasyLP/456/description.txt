A construction company is planning to allocate resources between two major projects, project $X$ and project $Y$. The total resources allocated cannot exceed 200 units due to budget constraints. To meet the requirements of both projects, the combined resources from twice the allocation for project X and that for project Y must be at least 100 units. Additionally, the difference in resource allocation between project X and project Y should not exceed 50 units to maintain a balance in workload. Each unit of resource allocated to projects $X$ and $Y$ costs \$5000 and \$3000 respectively. Considering that both allocations should be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources, within each specific bounds on resource allocation (project X: up to 150 units; project Y: up to 100 units), what is the minimum total cost for this scenario rounded to the nearest dollar?
