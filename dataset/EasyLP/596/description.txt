A transportation company needs to allocate its fleet of four types of vehicles: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$ for two major operations. The total number of vehicles available for each type are 700, 500, 600, and 800 respectively. Each type of vehicle has a different operating cost per day which is \$50, \$60, \$70, and \$80 respectively.\n\nFor the first operation, the company can only allocate a combined total of up to 1000 vehicles from types $x1$ and $x2$. For the second operation, they can allocate a combined total of up to 1200 vehicles from types $x3$ and $x4$. However, it is necessary that at least 800 vehicles come from types $x1$ or $x3$ to ensure enough heavy-duty capacity. Similarly, at least 600 vehicles must be either type $x2$ or type $x4$ for certain transportation requirements.\n\nThe company wants to minimize the total operating cost while meeting all these constraints considering that due to scheduling practicalities the number of allocated vehicles must be whole numbers. What would be this minimum daily operating cost in dollars rounded off to nearest dollar?
