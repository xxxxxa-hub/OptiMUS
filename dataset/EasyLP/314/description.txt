A military commander is planning to allocate resources across three different operations: Operation $X$, Operation $Y$, and Operation $Z$. The total number of available resources cannot exceed 100 units due to logistical constraints. To achieve the strategic objective, the combined effectiveness of these operations, calculated as 5 times the resources allocated to Operation X plus 3 times the resources allocated to Operation Y plus 7 times the resources allocated to Operation Z, must be at least 350 units. Additionally, a specific strategy requirement necessitates that twice the number of resources allocated to Operations X and Y subtracted from those for operation Z should be non-negative.\n\nThe costs associated with allocating a unit resource for Operations X, Y, and Z are \$5000, \$4000, and \$6000 respectively. Given these conditions and considering that resource allocation must be in whole numbers due to their indivisible nature, what is the minimum total cost (in dollars) for carrying out these operations while meeting all specified constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
