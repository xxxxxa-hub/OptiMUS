An environmental agency is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: X, Y, and Z. These projects could involve pollution control, conservation efforts, and renewable energy initiatives, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being \$50 for project X, \$60 for project Y and \$70 for project Z per unit of resource allocated.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic importance:\n- The combined resource allocation for twice the allocation for X plus thrice the allocation for Y and Z cannot be less than 500 units.\n- The sum of allocations for X, Y and four times the allocation for Z should not exceed 800 units.\n- The difference between allocations of X and Y added with that of Z should be at least 100 units.\n\nAlso note that each project has specific bounds on resource allocation: \n0 <= x <= 200,\n0 <= y <= 150,\n0 <= z <= 300\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of resources due to practicalities (as resources can't be divided), what is the minimum total cost in dollars required given optimal allocation? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.
