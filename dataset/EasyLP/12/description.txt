An energy company is planning to allocate resources between two projects, X and Y, where the allocations must be integers due to the nature of the resources. The total resource allocation across both projects cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. To meet strategic objectives, the combined effort of these projects must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as twice the resource allocation for project X plus the allocation for project Y, of at least 50 points. Additionally, the difference in resource allocation between project X and project Y should not exceed 30 units to maintain balance. Each unit of resource allocated towards projects X and Y incurs costs of 5 and 8 units respectively. The company aims to minimize this cost while meeting all constraints. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario in terms of resource units? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
