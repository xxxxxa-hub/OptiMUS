A construction manager is planning the resource allocation between two major tasks: Task $X$ and Task $Y$. The resources can only be allocated in whole numbers due to their nature. For each task, there are specific limits on how many resources can be allocated. Task $X$ can have up to 30 units of resources, while Task $Y$ can have up to 20 units.\n\nThe combined effort of five times the resources for Task $X$ and three times the resources for Task $Y$ cannot exceed 200 units due to equipment availability. To meet project deadlines, the sum of ten times the resources for Task $X$ and fifteen times the resources for Task $Y$ must be at least 300 units. Moreover, due to staff expertise limitations, the difference between the number of resources dedicated to Tasks X and Y should not exceed 50 units.\n\nGiven that every unit of resource used in Task X costs $\$10000$, and every unit used in task Y costs $\$15000$, what is minimum cost (in dollars) needed to allocate these resources while meeting all constraints?
