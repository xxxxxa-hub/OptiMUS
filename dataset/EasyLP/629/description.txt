A Human Resources manager is planning to allocate employees to four different departments: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These departments could be involved in operations, marketing, finance, and human resources respectively. The objective is to minimize the total payroll cost associated with these departments. The salaries for each department are $\$5000$ per employee for department $x1$, $\$6000$ per employee for department $x2$, $\$7000$ per employee for department $x3$, and $\$8000$ per employee for department $x4$. \n\nThe allocation of employees must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and operational requirements:\n- The combined number of employees in departments $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 40.\n- Similarly, the combined number of employees in departments $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 30.\n- To maintain a balance across all departments, there should be at least 10 more employees in department $x1$ than in department $x3$\n- Similarly, there should be at least 5 more employees in department $x2$ than in department$x4$\n\nIn addition to these constraints, each department has specific bounds on the number of employees it can accommodate due to physical or logistical limitations. Specifically,\ndepartment x1 can have between 0 and 20 employees,\ndepartment x2 can have between 0 and 20 employees,\ndepartment x3 can have between 0 and 15 employees,\ndepartment x4 can have between 0 and 15 employees.\n\nGiven these conditions (and assuming only whole numbers of workers), what is the minimum total payroll cost for this HR manager's situation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
