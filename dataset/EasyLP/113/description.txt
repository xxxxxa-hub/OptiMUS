In a sports training camp, there are two types of training drills: drill $X$ and drill $Y$. The coach plans to schedule these drills for the athletes in such a way that the total number of drills does not exceed 40 due to time constraints. To ensure a balanced development of skills, it is required that the sum of twice the number of drill X and the number of drill Y should be at least 30.\n\nEach instance of drill $X$ leads to a fatigue score increase by 2 units, while each instance of drill $Y$ increases it by 3 units. Considering that both X and Y must be integers as they represent whole instances of training drills, what is the minimum total fatigue score that can be achieved under these conditions? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
