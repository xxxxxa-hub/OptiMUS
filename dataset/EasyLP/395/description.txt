An environmental organization is planning four projects (x1, x2, x3, and x4) to mitigate the impact of climate change. These could include tree planting initiatives, renewable energy programs, carbon offsetting campaigns, and education & awareness drives. The cost per unit for each project is 10 for x1, 20 for x2, 30 for x3 and 40 for x4 respectively.\n\nThe following constraints have been set based on budgetary limitations and strategic priorities:- The combined units of projects x1 and x2 cannot exceed 50.- Project x3 must be at least 10 units more than project x4 due to its higher priority.- Twice the units of project x1 added to the units of project x3 should not exceed 60.- The number of units dedicated to project x2 should be at least five more than twice the units dedicated to project X4.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that the organization can only dedicate whole numbers of resources due to practicality reasons (e.g., you can't plant half a tree), what is the minimum total cost required for this environmental plan when adhering to all constraints? Answer rounded up to the nearest dollar.
