In a healthcare scenario, a hospital administrator is planning to schedule nurses and doctors for a particular shift. The objective is to minimize the total staffing cost, with costs being $7 per hour for a nurse and $10 per hour for a doctor. The scheduling must adhere to the following constraints due to service quality standards and regulatory requirements: \n\n- Each shift requires at least the equivalent of 20 hours of work from two nurses or one doctor.\n- In order not to exceed budget limitations, the combined hours worked by one nurse and three doctors cannot exceed 60 hours.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering that scheduling needs to be in whole numbers of hours, what is the minimum total staffing cost for this shift? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
