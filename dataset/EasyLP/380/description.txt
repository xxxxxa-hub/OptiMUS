In a sports training camp, a coach needs to distribute weekly hours of training across four different groups: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These groups could be focused on strength conditioning, speed training, skill development and strategy formation respectively. The fatigue scores associated with each hour of training are 10 for group X1, 15 for group X2, 20 for group X3 and 25 for group X4.\n\nThe allocation must follow the following constraints due to facility availability and rest requirements:\n- The combined training hours for groups X1 and X2 cannot exceed 12.\n- The combined training hours for groups X3 and X4 cannot exceed 16.\n- The total training hours between groups X1 and X3 must be at least 8 to ensure enough focus on physical conditioning.\n- Similarly, the total training hours between groups X2 and X4 must be at least 10 to ensure sufficient time spent on skill development and strategic planning.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the condition that all allocations need to be in whole numbers due to scheduling requirements (hours can't be split), what is the minimum possible total fatigue score while adhering to these conditions?
