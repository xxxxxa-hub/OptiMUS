An agricultural manager needs to allocate resources across three areas: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These could represent different crops or livestock that the farm produces. The total resources available for all three areas combined cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. To achieve a certain production target, the combined yield of 4 units from area X and 5 units from area Y must be at least 3000. Additionally, the yield from area Z minus three times the yield from area Y should not be less than -500, considering some interdependencies among the crops or animals being farmed.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ yields different returns or costs, quantified as 2 , 3 , and 1 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario in unit cost terms? Please round your answer to nearest whole number.
