A supply chain manager is planning to allocate resources between three different suppliers: $x1$, $x2$, and $x3$. These could represent investments in different regions or types of products. The total investment across all three suppliers cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. Additionally, the combined investment in supplier $x1$ (multiplied by two) and supplier $x2$ (multiplied by three) must be at least 50 units to meet the company's demand. Furthermore, four times the investment in supplier $x1$ minus five times the investment in supplier $x3$ should not exceed 30 units, perhaps reflecting specific risk management strategies.\n\nEach unit of investment in suppliers $x1$, $x2$, and $x3$ yields different returns or costs, quantified as 5 , 4 , and 3 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Please note that all investments are integer numbers due to contractual obligations and each supplier has a maximum limit on resource allocation:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number?
