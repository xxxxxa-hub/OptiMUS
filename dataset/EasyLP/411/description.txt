A real estate developer is planning to allocate investments across four different types of properties: residential ($x$), commercial ($y$), industrial ($z$), and mixed-use ($w$). The investments need to be in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the properties. Each type of property requires a different amount of investment, with costs being \$30000, \$40000, \$50000, and \$60000 for $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and market conditions:\n- The combined number of residential and commercial properties cannot exceed 20.\n- The combined number of industrial and mixed-use properties cannot exceed 30.\n- At least 10 properties must be either residential or industrial to diversify the portfolio.\n- At least 15 properties must be either commercial or mixed-use for higher returns.\n\nAdditionally, each type of property has a specific bound on investment:\nResidential (x) : [0 , 15]\nCommercial (y) : [0 , 20]\nIndustrial (z) : [0 , 25]\nMixed Use (w) : [0 , 30] \nThe objective is to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded off to the nearest dollar?
