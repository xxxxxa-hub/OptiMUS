A transportation company has two types of vehicles, $X$ and $Y$, that it uses to transport goods. The cost of operating each type of vehicle per day is \$5 for $X$ and \$10 for $Y$. To meet the daily demand, the company needs to operate at least 30 vehicles of type $X$ and at least 20 vehicles of type $Y$. However, due to budget constraints, the company can only operate a total of 100 vehicles (type X and Y combined) per day. Given that the number of vehicles must be whole numbers, what is the minimum daily operational cost in dollars for the company to meet its requirements while minimizing costs?
