A construction company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: $X1, X2$, and $X3$. These projects could involve building residential buildings, commercial complexes, and infrastructure facilities, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being $\$500$, $\$600$, and $\$700$ for each unit of resource allocated to $X1, X2$, and $X3$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and project requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The difference between twice the allocation for $X1$ and half the allocation for $X2$ must be at least 200 units. This could reflect specific requirements or priorities associated with project $X1$.\n- The difference between double the resource allocation for project $X3$ and that for project $X1$ must not exceed 300 units. This ensures a balanced distribution of resources across these two projects.\n\nGiven these constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that allocations for all three projects are in whole numbers (due to indivisible nature of certain resources) within specified bounds: What is the minimum total cost for the company given optimal resource allocations? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
