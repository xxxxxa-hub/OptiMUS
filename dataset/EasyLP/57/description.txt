A retail manager is planning to allocate budget between two types of goods for an upcoming sale: type $X$ and type $Y$. The total budget for both types combined is constrained to a maximum of 2000 units due to financial constraints. To ensure a balanced product offering, the amount allocated to type X must be at least half of that allocated to type Y plus 500 units. The allocations for both types should be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the goods. The cost per unit of goods for type $X$ is 2 units and for type $Y$ it's 3 units. Given these conditions, the manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints. However, each good has specific bounds on resource allocation: For good X it ranges from 0-1500 units and for good Y it ranges from 0-1000 units.\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost required given these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
