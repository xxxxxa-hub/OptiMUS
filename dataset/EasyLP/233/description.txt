A farmer has three types of crops to plant on his farm: wheat, corn, and soybean. He wants to determine how many acres he should dedicate to each type of crop in order to minimize the total cost of planting. The costs per acre for wheat, corn, and soybean are \$10, \$15, and \$20 respectively.\n\nThe farmer must adhere to the following conditions due to certain farming constraints:- The combined area for twice the amount of wheat plus corn cannot exceed 500 acres.- The combined area for wheat and soybean must be at least 300 acres.- Additionally, the difference in area between corn and soybean cannot be more than 100 acres.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that he can only plant whole numbers of acres due to practical limitations, along with individual upper bounds on areas dedicated to each crop (400 acres for wheat, 200 for corn, and 300 for soybeans), what is the minimum total cost that would allow the farmer to meet all these requirements?
