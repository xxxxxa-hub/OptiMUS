A finance manager is planning the allocation of a $10,000 budget across four investment options: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These investments could represent different financial instruments like stocks, bonds, mutual funds or real estate. The objective is to minimize the total risk associated with these investments. Risks are quantified as 0.06 for x1, 0.05 for x2, 0.07 for x3 and 0.08 for x4.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to diversification strategy and specific requirements of each investment:- The combined allocations for all four investments must equal $10,000.- To maintain a balanced risk-return profile across the portfolio, the return from investment option X1 (at a rate of 4%) minus that from X2 (at a rate of 2%) must be at least $200.- To avoid excessive exposure to certain types of assets or markets, the difference in allocation between X3 and twice that of X4 should not exceed $500.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that all investments need to be made in whole dollar amounts due to transactional restrictions and each investment has specific lower and upper limits on allocations:What is the minimum total risk score associated with this portfolio given optimal allocation across four investments within specified bounds?
