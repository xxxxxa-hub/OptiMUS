A shipping company is planning to allocate resources across four different types of ships: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These could represent different sizes or classes of ships. The total number of $x1$ and $x2$ ships cannot exceed 1000 due to docking space limitations. Similarly, the total number of $x3$ and $x4$ ships is limited to 1500 because of the availability of crew members. Further, the number of $x1$ ships must be at least twice that of half the number of $x3$ ships for balance in cargo carrying capacity. On the other hand, no more than half the number of $x4$ ships can be added to the fleet without exceeding the count of ship type $x2$ by 400 units to maintain operational efficiency.\n\nEach type has a different operating cost per unit: 50 units for ship type $x1$, 60 units for ship type $x2$, 70 units for ship type $x3$, and 80 units for ship type$x4$. The company aims to minimize these costs while adhering to all constraints and ensuring that all allocations are integers due to indivisible nature.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total operating cost in units? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
