A manufacturing company is planning the production of three products: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total number of products manufactured cannot exceed 1000 units due to capacity constraints. To meet market demand, at least 300 units must be produced by combining twice the production of product X and product Y. Additionally, the sum of units produced for product X and thrice that for product Z should not exceed 600 units, possibly due to raw material availability or other operational limitations. Each unit of product X, Y, and Z incurs different costs, quantified as 50 , 30 , and 20 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these production constraints and ensuring that all productions are in whole numbers due to the nature of manufacturing processes. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario.
