An educational institution is planning to allocate funds to four different programs: $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$. These could be for upgrading facilities, providing scholarships, research funding, and implementing new technologies respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these programs. The costs per unit of allocation are $10$ for program $x1$, $15$ for program $x2$, $25$ for program $x3$, and $35$ for program $x4$. \n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations:- The combined resource allocation for programs $x1$ and $x2$ cannot be less than 20 units.- The combined resource allocation for programs $x3$ and $x4$ should not exceed 40 units.- The difference between the allocations of program$x1$ and twice that of program$x3$ should be at least 5 units.- The difference between the allocations of program$x4$ and program$x2$ should not exceed 10 units.\n\nGiven these constraints, along with the requirement that all allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of financial resources, each project has specific bounds on fund allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost required by this institution if they optimally allocate their funds among these four projects within specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
