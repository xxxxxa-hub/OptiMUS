A transportation manager is planning to allocate vehicles among three different routes: X, Y, and Z. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost associated with these routes, with costs being $5, $7$, and $3$ per vehicle for routes X, Y, and Z respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and traffic conditions:\n- The combined number of vehicles on routes X, Y, and Z cannot exceed 1000.\n- Twice the number of vehicles on route X plus thrice the number of vehicles on route Y should be at least 500. This might be due to heavier traffic or larger distances covered by these routes.\n- The sum of vehicles on routes X and Z minus those on route Y should not exceed 400. This could be a requirement based on specific demands or road conditions.\n- The number of vehicles running on route Y should be at least 100 more than those on route Z. This could reflect higher demand or capacity for route Y.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the requirement that all allocations must be in whole numbers due to practical reasons (you can't operate a fraction of a vehicle), what is the minimum total operating cost for the transportation manager? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
