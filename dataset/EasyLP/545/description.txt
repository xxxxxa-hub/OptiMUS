In a supply chain management scenario, an operations manager needs to plan the allocation of resources among three critical areas: Warehouse (W), Transport (T), and Retail (R). These allocations represent investments in these areas and must be integers due to the nature of the resources involved. The objective is to minimize the total operational cost, which for each unit invested is \$3 for W, \$2 for T, and \$4 for R.\n\nThe following constraints apply:\n- The combined investment in W and T should be at least 500 units, considering minimum capacity requirements.\n- The difference between investment in W and R should not exceed 2000 units, ensuring balanced resource allocation across these areas.\n- The sum of investments in W and R must equal 3000 units due to budget limitations.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum possible operational cost rounded off to the nearest dollar?
