A tourism agency plans to allocate its budget across three promotional campaigns: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ which focus on promoting city tours, nature expeditions, and cultural experiences respectively. The total budget allocated across all three campaigns cannot exceed 50 units due to financial constraints. Campaign $X$ requires a minimum allocation of 10 units, while campaign $Y$ needs at least 15 units due to higher advertising costs. Campaign $Z$ requires a minimum allocation of 5 units considering the cost of creating promotional materials. Each unit of investment in campaigns $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as 500, 400, and 300 units respectively. The agency aims to minimize the total investment cost while adhering to the investment constraints for each campaign and ensuring that all investments are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of monetary resources being allocated. What is the minimum total investment cost required for this scenario in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
