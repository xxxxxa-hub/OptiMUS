A telecommunications company is planning to distribute the network bandwidth between two types of services: $X$ and $Y$. The total bandwidth available cannot exceed 10,000 Mbps. To meet the customer's requirements, the combined capacity of these services must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as 2 times the bandwidth for service X plus 3 times the bandwidth for service Y, of at least 5000 points. Given that the cost per unit of effectiveness for service $X$ is $\$0.2$ per Mbps and for service $Y$ it is $\$0.3$ per Mbps, and considering all units should be in whole numbers due to system limitations. What is the minimum total cost in dollars to satisfy all constraints while minimizing costs?
