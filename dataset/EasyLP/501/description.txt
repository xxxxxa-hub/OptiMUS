In a real estate investment scenario, an investor is considering investing in two types of properties: residential (represented by $x$) and commercial (represented by $y$). Each type of property requires a certain amount of capital for investment. The cost per unit of investment for residential properties is $\$1000$, while the cost for commercial properties is $\$500$. Due to budget constraints, the total units of both residential and commercial properties cannot exceed 50.\n\nHowever, to diversify risk and ensure stable returns, there are some restrictions on the allocation between these two types of investments:\n- The investor must invest in at least 10 units of residential properties ($x \geq 10$).\n- The investor must also invest in at least 20 units of commercial properties ($y \geq 20$).\n- Moreover, the number of residential property units should not exceed the number of commercial property units by more than 10 ($x - y \leq 10$).\n\nGiven that all investments need to be made in whole numbers due to indivisibility considerations and each type has specific bounds on unit allocation. How much would it cost for this investor if he wants to minimize his total investment cost under these conditions? Please give your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
