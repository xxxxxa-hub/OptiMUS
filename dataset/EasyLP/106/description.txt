A sports coach is planning a training regime for two types of exercises, X and Y. The intensity score for exercise X is 8 units per hour and for exercise Y it's 12 units per hour. The total time spent on both exercises should not exceed 20 hours. However, to ensure an effective training session, the combined effort from these exercises must yield a minimum effectiveness score which is calculated as 5 times the hours spent on exercise X plus 3 times the hours spent on exercise Y. This combined effort should be at least 15 points. Given that the coach aims to minimize the intensity score while meeting all constraints (with whole numbers of hours), what would be the minimum total intensity score?
