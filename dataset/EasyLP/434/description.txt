In a financial planning scenario, an investor is deciding how to allocate their total investment of \$20,000 between two options: Stocks and Bonds. The investment in both stocks and bonds must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of these securities. To meet his portfolio diversification objectives, he has set the following conditions:\n\n- The combined value from three times the investment in stocks plus twice that in bonds should be at least \$10,000.\n- The difference between the investments in stocks and bonds cannot exceed \$5,000.\n\nGiven that the cost per unit for stocks is \$10 and for bonds it is \$5, and aiming to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints: What will be the minimum total cost for this investor's portfolio? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
