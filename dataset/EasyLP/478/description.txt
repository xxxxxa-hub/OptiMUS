An educational institution is planning to allocate budget between two programs, Program X and Program Y. The cost per student for Program X is $\$500$ and for Program Y it's $\$300$. Due to resource constraints, the total number of students that can be admitted in both programs combined cannot exceed $25$. Additionally, due to certain accreditation requirements, the institution must admit at least $10$ students into Program X and at least $5$ students into Program Y. The objective of the institution is to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints (assuming the number of students in each program should be a whole number). What is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
