An energy company is planning to expand its renewable energy portfolio by investing in solar and wind power projects. Each project represents an individual unit of solar or wind power generation capacity that can be developed. The company aims to minimize the total investment cost, with each solar project costing 7 units and each wind project costing 5 units.\n\nHowever, there are certain constraints that must be met due to regulatory requirements and technical feasibility:- To ensure a balanced mix of energy sources, the combined capacity from two units of solar power and three units of wind power must be at least 10.- On the other hand, due to limitations in grid capacity or other infrastructure considerations, the total capacity from four units of solar power and one unit of wind power cannot exceed 15.\n\nGiven these conditions, along with the requirement that investments must be made in whole numbers of projects due to practical considerations,What is the minimum total investment cost for the company given optimal allocation between solar and wind projects? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
