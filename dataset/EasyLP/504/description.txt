A marketing manager is planning to distribute a budget between three advertising channels: $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$ for an upcoming campaign. The budget allocated for each channel cannot exceed 5000, 4000, and 3000 units respectively, with the total budget across all three channels not exceeding 10000 units. To meet the campaign's reach and frequency objectives, the combined effort of these channels must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as twice the budget for channel $X1$ minus thrice that of channel $X2$ plus four-and-a-half times that of channel $X3$, at least 2000 points. Additionally, to ensure balanced exposure across different media platforms, the difference between half of the budget allocated to channel $X2$ and sum of budgets allocated to channels $X1$ and three-quarters of that for channel $X3$ should not exceed 1500 units.\n\nThe cost per unit of effectiveness for channels $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$ are 5000 ,3000 ,and 7000 respectively. The marketing manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints (all budgets are integers). What would be the minimum total cost in dollars given these conditions? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
