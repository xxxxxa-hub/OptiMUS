In a sports tournament, a team manager needs to determine the number of matches to be played in two different sports: X and Y. The total number of matches that can be accommodated is limited to 50 due to scheduling constraints. To ensure competitiveness and audience interest, the combined count of twice the matches for sport X and matches for sport Y must be at least 30. Moreover, the difference between the matches for sport X and twice that for sport Y should not exceed 10 to maintain balance between both sports.\n\nThe fatigue scores associated with each match are 4 for sport X and 3 for sport Y. The manager aims to minimize the total fatigue score while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of matches for both sports X and Y are integers due to scheduling practicalities.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total fatigue score if we optimally schedule all games? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
