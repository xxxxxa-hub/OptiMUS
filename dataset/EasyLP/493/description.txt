A shipping company needs to distribute its resources between two types of vessels, X and Y. The combined number of vessels in service cannot exceed 100 due to port capacity constraints. To meet service level requirements, the total operational capacity, calculated as twice the number of type X vessels plus three times the number of type Y vessels, must be at least 50. Additionally, to maintain a balanced fleet composition, the difference in the number of type X and type Y vessels should not exceed 20.\n\nThe daily operating costs are different for each type of vessel: $3 for a vessel of type X and $2 for a vessel of type Y. The company aims to minimize its total daily operating cost while meeting all these constraints (note that because ships cannot be fractionally operated, both X and Y must be integers). What is the minimum total daily operating cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
