A telecommunications company is planning to distribute resources between three different projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent various aspects such as upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, or implementing new technologies. The total resources available for distribution across all three projects are limited to 100 units due to budget constraints. To achieve certain strategic objectives, the combined resource allocation of two times project X plus project Y must be at least 50 units. In addition, the sum of resources allocated to project X and project Z should not exceed 70 units.\n\nEach unit of resource in projects $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ costs 50 , 30 , and 20 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. It should also be noted that the allocations must be in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to nearest whole number.
