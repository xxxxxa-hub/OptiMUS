A transportation company is planning to allocate resources among four different routes: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. The costs associated with these routes are 10, 20, 30, and 40 units respectively for each unit of resource. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting certain constraints due to logistical considerations.\n\nThe combined allocation of resources for routes $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units due to vehicle availability. Similarly, the combined allocation for routes $x3$ and $x4$ must not exceed 2000 units because of driver availability.\n\nAdditionally, there are constraints related to demand on different routes:\nThe allocation for route $x3$ should be at least by 500 units more than that for route $x1$. Similarly, the allocation for route $x4$ should be greater than or equal to that for route $x2$ by at least 300 units.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of resource allocations (since fractions of vehicles are impractical), along with individual upper limits on resource allocations per route ($700$ for route x1, $\800$ for x2 , $\900$for x3 , $\1000$for x4)\nThe question is: What is the minimum total cost in terms of unit cost required given an optimal distribution of resources among these four routes? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
