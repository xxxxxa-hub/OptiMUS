A shipping company has four different types of cargo: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. The company is planning to allocate space in their ships for these cargos. Each type of cargo requires a certain amount of space per unit and the cost associated with transporting each unit of cargo is 4, 3, 5, and 7 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to ship capacity and demand:\n- The combined units of cargo $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000.\n- The combined units of cargo $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 800.\n- To meet minimum demand requirements, the total units shipped for cargo $x1$ and $x3$ must be at least 500.\n- Similarly, to meet another set of demand requirements, the total units shipped for cargo $x2$ and $x4$ must be at least 600.\n\nAdditionally, each type of cargo has specific bounds on how many units can be shipped:\n- For cargo type $x1$, between 0 and 700 units can be transported.\n- For cargo type $x2$, between 0 and 600 units can be transported.\n- For cargo type $x3$, between 0 and 400 units can be transported.\n- For cargo type $x4$, between 0 and 500 units can be transported. \nThe number of each type of cargo are integers as they represent discrete physical items. \nThe question is: What is the minimum total transportation cost for the company given these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
