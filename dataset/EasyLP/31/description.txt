A transportation company has to deliver goods using two types of vehicles, type X and type Y. The cost per trip for a vehicle of type $X$ is $\$0.5$, and for a vehicle of type $Y$ is $\$1$. The total number of trips that can be made by both types combined cannot exceed 10,000 due to operational constraints. However, to fulfill all orders, the company needs to make at least 3,000 trips with vehicles of type X and at least 2,000 trips with vehicles of type Y. Given these constraints and aiming for whole numbers of trips due to scheduling practicalities, what is the minimum total cost for the company to deliver all goods? Provide the answer in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar.
