A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: x1, x2, and x3. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, and improving data security respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 3 units for project X1, 2 units for project X2, and 5 units for project X3.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:- The combined resource allocation for all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units.- The resource allocation for twice of Project X1 minus thrice of Project X3 must be at least 500 units. This reflects the higher importance or complexity of certain projects.- The combined resource allocation for four times of Project X2 and Project X3 must not exceed 1200 units.\n\nIn addition to these conditions, each project has a specific limit on its maximum allowable resources due to various practical considerations. Specifically, the limits are as follows: - For Project X1 it ranges from 0 up to a maximum of 400 units.- For Project X2 it ranges from 0 up to a maximum of 300 units.- For Project X3 it ranges from 0 up to a maximum of 600 units.\n\nGiven that allocations should be made in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of some resources:\nWhat is the minimum total cost required by the telecommunications company given these constraints?
