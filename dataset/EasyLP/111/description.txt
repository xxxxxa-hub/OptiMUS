In a sports team, the coach needs to allocate resources between training hours and equipment costs. The resources need to be allocated in such a way that for every 3 hours of training, there must be at least 2 units of equipment cost available and this combined value should be at least 15. On the other hand, for every 4 hours of training, there can't be more than 3 units of equipment cost and this combined value should not exceed 50.\n\nEach hour of training has a fatigue score of $6$ while each unit of equipment cost contributes $4$ to the fatigue score. The aim is to minimize the total fatigue score while adhering to these constraints. Given that both training hours and equipment costs are integers due to practical considerations, what is the minimum total fatigue score possible? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
