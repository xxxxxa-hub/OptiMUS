A transportation company is planning to allocate resources between four different routes: X1, X2, X3, and X4. These could represent different shipping lanes or transport routes. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these routes, with costs being 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.2 units for X1, X2, X3 and X4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and traffic regulations:\n- The combined resource allocation for routes X1 and X2 cannot exceed 300 units.\n- Similarly, the combined allocation for routes X3 and X4 cannot surpass 500 units.\n- The weighted difference of allocations - subtracting the allocation for route X1 from 0.7 times that of route X2; then subtracting the allocation for route X3 from this value; finally adding on 0.9 times that of route x4 - must be at least equal to a positive number of 100 units.\n- Another requirement involves calculating the difference between allocations for routes x3 and x4 (multiplying x4's allocation by a factor of 0.8), then subtracting from this value the sum of allocations for both x1 and x2 - this calculated amount should not exceed a limit of 200 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the constraint that all resource allocations must be whole numbers due to logistical requirements (e.g., you can't operate half a vehicle or send half a shipment), what is minimum total cost given an optimal distribution across these four routes within their respective bounds? Please round your answer to one decimal place.
