A construction company is planning to allocate resources across three types of projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different construction technologies or infrastructure. The total investment across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. The combined strength of 3 units of X and 2 units of Y must be at least 400, representing the minimum requirement for effective operation. The difference between project Z and project Y should not exceed 300 units, ensuring balanced distribution of resources. Additionally, the resource allocation for project X should always be greater than twice that for project Z.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as \$300 , \$500 , and \$200 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are integers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar.
