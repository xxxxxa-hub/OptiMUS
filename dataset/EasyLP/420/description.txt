In an energy optimization scenario, a company is considering two projects: Project X and Project Y. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total resource allocated to 5 times the investment in project X and 3 times the investment in project Y cannot exceed 500 units due to budget constraints. To ensure sufficient coverage across the portfolio, the sum of investments in both projects must be at least 60 units. In addition, due to regulatory requirements or other limitations, the difference between the investments for project X and twice that of project Y should not exceed 30 units.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects X and Y yields different returns or costs, quantified as 50 and 70 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total investment cost while adhering to these constraints. Also note that all investments are whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources being allocated.\n\nGiven these conditions, calculate the minimum total investment cost required for this scenario rounded to nearest dollar.
