In a human resources planning scenario, a company needs to allocate employees across three departments: $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$. These departments could represent different business units or functions within the organization. The total number of employees that can be allocated is limited to 10 due to budget constraints. Department $X1$ requires a minimum of 2 employees, department $X2$ needs at least 3 employees, and department $X3$ requires no fewer than 5 employees. Each employee in departments $X1$, $X2$, and $X3$ costs the company \$50000, \$60000, and \$70000 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Additionally, each department has specific bounds on staffing levels: Department X1 can have between 0 and 6 employees; Department X2 can have between 0 and 4; Department X3 can have between 0 and 5. All allocations must be whole numbers as fractional employment is not feasible.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar.
