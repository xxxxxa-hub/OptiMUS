A Human Resources manager is planning the allocation of new hires between two departments, $X$ and $Y$. The company needs to hire at least 10 new employees. However, due to space limitations in the office, the combined effort for these departments, calculated as 3 times the number of hires for department X plus 4 times the number of hires for department Y, must not exceed 40.\n\nGiven that the annual salary per employee for department $X$ is $\$50000$, and for department $Y$ it's $\$60000$, and the HR manager aims to minimize total salaries while meeting all constraints(X,Y are integers). Find the minimum total annual salary cost in dollars rounded to nearest dollar.
