An environmental organization is planning to allocate funds across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent investments in different environmental initiatives like reforestation, wildlife conservation, and pollution control. The total fund allocation across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum excess of 200 units over twice the allocation for project $Y$, reflecting its relative importance or cost. Additionally, the fund allocation for project $Z$ must be at least 100 units more than that of project $Y$, indicating its higher priority or need.\n\nEach unit of funding allocated to projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ has associated costs of 2 , 3 , and 1 units respectively. The organization aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of financial resources.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number.
