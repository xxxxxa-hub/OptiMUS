A construction company is planning to allocate manpower to two types of tasks, task X and task Y. Due to the nature of the tasks, the allocations must be in whole numbers. The combined effort for 2 units of task X and 3 units of task Y cannot exceed a maximum limit of 120 hours due to time constraints. To achieve project objectives, at least a total sum of 40 hours should be allocated between tasks X and Y. Each hour spent on task X costs \$50 while each hour spent on task Y costs \$30. The company aims to minimize total cost while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this operation, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
