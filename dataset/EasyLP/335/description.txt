An energy company is planning to allocate resources across four different types of power plants: Coal, Gas, Solar, and Nuclear. The total output capacity across all four types must be at least 1000 MW to meet the grid demand. Each type has a different cost per MW - Coal costs \$50/MW, Gas costs \$60/MW, Solar costs \$70/MW, and Nuclear costs \$80/MW.\n\nHowever, there are several constraints that need to be considered:\n- The coal-fired power plant's maximum capacity is limited to 500 MW due to emission regulations.- The output from the solar power plant must exceed that of the nuclear power plant by at least 200 MW to meet renewable energy targets.- The difference in output between the gas-fired and solar power plants cannot exceed 150 MW for grid stability reasons.\n\nFurthermore, each type of power plant also has its own minimum and maximum operational limits:- Coal: can range from 0 to 600 MW- Gas: can range from 0 to 400 MW- Solar: must produce at least 300 MW- Nuclear: must produce at least 100 MW\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of megawatts due to practical constraints on power plant operation. What is the minimum total cost for operating these plants while meeting all requirements? Provide your answer in dollars rounded up to nearest dollar.
