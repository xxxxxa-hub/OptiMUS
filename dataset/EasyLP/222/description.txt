A retail store manager needs to allocate the available space for three types of products: X, Y, and Z. The total space allocated cannot exceed 1000 square meters due to the size of the store. Product X requires a minimum space of 200 square meters, product Y requires at least 150 square meters, and product Z needs a minimum of 100 square meters. Each type of product generates different revenues per square meter: product X generates $5, product Y generates $3, and product Z generates $2. The store manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the units being allocated (i.e., we cannot allocate fractions of a square meter). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
