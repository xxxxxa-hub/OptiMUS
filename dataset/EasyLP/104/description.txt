A company's human resources department is planning the allocation of full-time employees between two projects: Project $X$ and Project $Y$. The total number of employees allocated to both projects combined must be at least 20, due to the minimum manpower requirements. Moreover, because of limited resources, twice the number of employees in project $X$ plus the number of employees in project $Y$ cannot exceed 40.\n\nEach employee assigned to Project $X$ costs the company $\$50$ per day while each employee assigned to Project $Y$ costs $\$80$ per day. Given that all allocations are integers (due to whole persons being allocated), what is the minimum daily cost for this staffing plan, rounded to the nearest dollar?
