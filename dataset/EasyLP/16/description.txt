An energy company is planning to allocate resources between two projects, X and Y. The total resource allocation must be at least 50 units due to minimum project requirements. Furthermore, the allocation for twice the amount of project X minus that of project Y cannot exceed 30 units to maintain a balanced portfolio.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to projects X and Y has associated costs, quantified as 4 and 3 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded to the nearest whole number?
