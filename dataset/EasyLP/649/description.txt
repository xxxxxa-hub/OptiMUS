A shipping company is planning to allocate resources across four types of shipments: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These could represent different categories of goods, routes, or modes of transport. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these shipments. The costs per unit shipment for $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$ are 5, 6, 7 and 8 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to logistical limitations:\n- The combined number of shipments for type $x1$ and type $x2$ cannot exceed 1000.\n- Similarly, the combined number of shipments for type $x3$ and type $x4$ cannot exceed 800.\n- The difference between the number of shipments for type x1 and half that of type x3 must be at least 200. This might reflect specific requirements related to cargo volume or weight.\n- Furthermore, a quarter of the number of shipments for type x4 minus that for type x2 should be at least 150. This might reflect regulatory compliance requirements or strategic objectives.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering practicalities such as the indivisible nature of a shipment (meaning that all allocations should be whole numbers) and each shipment has specific bounds on resource allocation: \nWhat is the minimum total cost in units needed by this shipping company given optimal allocation within specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
