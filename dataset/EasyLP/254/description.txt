A supply chain manager is planning the distribution of resources between three warehouses: X, Y, and Z. The total resources available cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Warehouse Y and Z combined must receive at least 800 units to fulfill their demand. Additionally, the difference in resource allocation between warehouse X and Z must not exceed 200 units to maintain a balanced supply chain.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated costs differently depending on the warehouse: it's \$2 for warehouse X, \$3 for warehouse Y, and \$1 for warehouse Z. The supply chain manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints and ensuring that allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this operation, rounded to nearest dollar?
