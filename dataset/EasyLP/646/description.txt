In a military logistics operation, the commander needs to allocate resources among four different units: X1, X2, X3, and X4. These could be different types of personnel or equipment, for instance. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these allocations while meeting several operational constraints.\n\nThe combined allocation for units X1 and X2 must be at least 200 to ensure sufficient manpower or equipment for essential operations. On the other hand, the difference in allocation between units X3 and X4 cannot exceed 50 units, possibly due to balance in roles or capabilities required. Additionally, two times the allocation for unit X2 minus that for unit X1 and half of that for unit X3 must not exceed 100 units.\n\nInterestingly, there's a strict requirement such that three-quarters of the allocation for unit X1 exactly equals the allocation for unit X4 plus 150 - this could reflect some fixed ratios in personnel or equipment requirements between these units.\n\nOverall, the total allocations across all four units cannot exceed 500 due to overall resource limitations. Also note that due to practical reasons related to how resources can be allocated (e.g., whole numbers of personnel), all allocations must be integers within specific bounds: from 0 up to 300 for unit x1; from 0 up to 250 for unit x2; from 0 up to 400 for unit x3; from 0 up to 350 for unit x4.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming at minimizing costs which are respectively associated with each hour of training as follows: $10$ per one resource on $X_1$, $15$ per one resource on $X_2$, $20$ per one resource on $X_3$, and $25$ per one resource on $X_4$. What would be the minimum total cost if we were to optimally allocate resources under these constraints? Please round the answer to the nearest dollar.
