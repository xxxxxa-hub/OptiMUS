A manufacturing company is planning the production of three types of products: X, Y, and Z. The total production cannot exceed 1000 units due to capacity constraints. The company must also meet a certain performance metric which is calculated as five times the units of product X plus three times the units of product Y minus the units of product Z, and this metric must be at least 500. Additionally, the sum of units produced for product X and product Z minus the units for product Y should not exceed 400 to ensure balanced portfolio.\n\nThe costs associated with producing each unit are $10 for product X, $15 for product Y, and $20 for product Z. Given that all productions are in whole numbers due to practicality reasons and that the company aims to minimize total cost while adhering to these constraints:\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost (in dollars) required given these conditions? Please round your answer to nearest dollar.
