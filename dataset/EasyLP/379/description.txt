In a human resources scenario, a company is planning to allocate employees across four different departments: X1, X2, X3, and X4. The objective is to minimize the total workload of the company, with workloads being 30, 40, 50, and 60 units for departments X1, X2, X3, and X4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to manpower limitations:- The combined number of employees in department X1 and department X2 should be at least 10.- The combined number of employees in department X2 and department X3 should not exceed 20.- The number of employees in department x3 should be at least five more than those in department x4.- A weighted combination of employee numbers (0.5 times the count from department x1 + 0.6 times from x2 - 0.7 times from x3 + 0.8 times from x4) must not exceed 15 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the requirement that the allocations for departments must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of an employee's time:What is the minimum total workload for the company given optimal allocation within specified bounds?
