A hospital is planning to optimize its staffing levels to ensure the availability of healthcare services while minimizing costs. The hospital needs to staff two types of roles: doctors and nurses. The cost per shift for a doctor is $\$10$ and for a nurse, it is $\$20$. According to hospital policy and patient safety regulations, there must be at least $50$ staff members (doctors + nurses) on duty at all times. On the other hand, due to budget constraints and space limitations, the total number of staff (2 times the number of doctors + nurses) cannot exceed $120$. Note that the number of doctors and nurses must be whole numbers as you can't have fractional employees. \n\nWhat is the minimum possible total cost per shift for staffing these roles? Please provide your answer in dollars rounded up to nearest whole dollar.
