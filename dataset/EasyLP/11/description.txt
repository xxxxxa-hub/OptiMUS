An energy company is planning to allocate resources between two projects: Project $X$ and Project $Y$. The projects represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. There are certain constraints that the company needs to adhere to due to regulatory and physical limitations. The combined effort of these projects, calculated as 4 times the resources for project X plus 6 times the resources for project Y, must yield a minimum output score of at least 12 units. Also, the combined resource consumption, calculated as 3 times the resources for project X plus 5 times the resources for project Y, should not exceed a maximum of 15 units. Each unit of investment in projects $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs quantified as \$7 and \$10 respectively. The company aims to minimize this total cost while adhering to all constraints. Given that both x and y need to be whole numbers because of the nature of resources allocated, find the minimum total cost in dollars required for these operations.
