A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources among three projects: Project X1, Project X2, and Project X3. These could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, or implementing new technologies respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost of these projects where costs are associated as $10 per unit for project X1, $20 per unit for project X2 and $30 per unit for project X3.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary and operational limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for project X1 and twice that allocated to project X2 should not exceed 2000 units.\n- The sum of thrice the allocation for project X1 and quadruple that of project X3 should be at least 1000 units.\n- The difference between the resources allocated to project X2 and five times those allocated to project X3 should not surpass 500 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with the requirement that allocations (X1, X2, and X3) must be in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of resources. Additionally each project has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nWhat would be the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please round your answer off to the nearest dollar.
