A military general is planning the distribution of his resources between tanks and aircraft for an upcoming operation. The total weight that can be supported by the transport system is limited to 10,000 tons, with each tank weighing 3 tons and each aircraft weighing 4 tons. To meet the operation's strategic objectives, the combined firepower of these units must yield a minimum score, calculated as twice the firepower score for each tank plus one time the firepower score for each aircraft, of at least 2000 points. Given that the cost per unit for a tank is \$5000 and for an aircraft is \$3000, and the general aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (the number of tanks and aircrafts are integers). Find out what will be the minimum total cost in dollars?
