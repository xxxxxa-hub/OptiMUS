A real estate developer is planning to invest in residential (X) and commercial (Y) properties. The total number of properties that the developer can invest in is limited to 1000 due to financial constraints. To diversify the investment portfolio, the combined property count of thrice the residential properties and twice the commercial properties must be at least 2000. Additionally, to maintain a balance between residential and commercial investments, the difference in numbers between residential and commercial properties should not exceed 300.\n\nThe cost per unit for a residential property is $200$ thousand dollars, while it's $150$ thousand dollars for a commercial one. The developer aims to minimize total investment cost while adhering to these constraints. Also, since you cannot purchase a fraction of a property, investments in both residential and commercial properties should be whole numbers.\n\nGiven these conditions, calculate the minimum total investment required by this real estate developer rounded to nearest thousand dollars.
