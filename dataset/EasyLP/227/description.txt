A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: x1, x2, and x3. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, and improving data security respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects. The costs associated with each unit of resource allocation for x1, x2, and x3 are 5 units, 4 units, and 3 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for x1 plus twice the allocation for project x2 cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- Three times the resource allocation for project x1 minus the resource allocation for project x2 plus the resource allocation for project x3 must be at least 500 units.\n- Minus one times the resource allocated to project x1 plus four times the resources allocated to project X2 minus two times resources allocated to Project X3 must exactly equal 200 units.\n\nIn addition to this each of the projects have specific bounds on their respective allocations as follows:\nx1 can range from a minimum of zero to a maximum of 500 units,\nx2 can range from a minimum of zero to a maximum of 300 units,\nx3 can range from a minimum of zero up-to a maximum of 400 units.\nThe allocations also need be whole numbers due its nature (like manpower or equipment that cannot be fractional).\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in terms of unit cost given these constraints?
