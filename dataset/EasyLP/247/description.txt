In a scheduling scenario, a manager needs to allocate working hours between three teams: X, Y, and Z. The total combined hours for all three teams cannot exceed 24 due to operational constraints. Team X requires at least 6 hours of work, team Y needs at least 4 hours, and team Z needs at least 2 hours. Each hour of work costs the company different amounts for each team: \$8 per hour for team X, \$5 per hour for team Y, and \$7 per hour for team Z.\n\nThe manager's objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints. Moreover, since it is not feasible to split an hour into fractions when allocating working hours among the teams (meaning that the number of working hours allocated must be a whole number), what is the minimum total cost required? Provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole number.
