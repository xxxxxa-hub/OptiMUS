A tourism manager is planning the distribution of budget between two promotional campaigns for an upcoming season. The total budget for both campaigns combined is constrained to a maximum of 1000 units. To meet the campaign's reach and frequency objectives, the combined effort of these campaigns must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as 2 times the budget for campaign X plus the budget for campaign Y, of at least 500 points. Additionally, to ensure balance in promotion, the difference between budgets allocated to campaign X and Y should not exceed 200 units.\n\nGiven that the cost per unit of effectiveness for campaign $X$ is 500 units and for campaign $Y$ it is 300 units, and if we consider each unit as \$1. The tourism manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints(X,Y are integers). What would be minimum total cost in dollars given these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
