In a healthcare management scenario, a hospital needs to allocate resources across four departments: $X1$, $X2$, $X3$, and $X4$. These could represent different specializations such as cardiology, neurology, orthopedics, and pediatrics respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these departments, with costs being 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 units for $X1$, $X2$, $X3$ and $X4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and operational requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for departments $X1$ and $X2$ cannot exceed 100 units.\n- The sum of allocations for departments $X2$ and $X3$ must be at least 50 units.\n- The difference between the allocations for department $X3$ and department $X4$ must not exceed 30 units.\n- Considering certain strategic objectives quantified by the equation: (10 times allocation for department X1) + (15 times allocation for department X2) - (5 times allocation for department X3) - (20 times allocation for department X4) must be at least 150 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with bounds on each individual department's resource allotment ranging from no lower bound up to specific upper limits like: Department X1 can't receive more than 100 units; Department X2 can't receive more than 80 units; Department X3 can't receive more than 60 units; Department X4 can't receive more than 50 units;\n\nand considering that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated, what is the minimum total cost required under this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number in units.
