In a sports team, the coach needs to allocate the training hours between two types of training: $X$ (strength conditioning) and $Y$ (skill development). The total hours for both types combined cannot exceed 10 hours. To achieve a balanced program, the strength conditioning hours should be at least one hour more than skill development hours. Additionally, the sum of twice the strength conditioning hours and skill development hours must exactly be 15.\n\nGiven that each hour of strength conditioning contributes to 2 fatigue points and each hour of skill development contributes to 3 fatigue points, and the coach aims to minimize total fatigue while meeting all constraints (and ensuring whole number of training hours due to scheduling practicalities), what is the minimum total fatigue score for the team? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
