In a supply chain management scenario, a company needs to allocate resources across four different activities: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$. These could represent the production of four different products or operations in four different regions. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these activities, with costs being 2, 3, 4 and 5 units for $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and operational requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for activity $x1$ and activity $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- Similarly, the combined resource allocation for activity $x3$ and activity $x4$ cannot exceed 800 units.\n- Half of the resources allocated to activity x1 minus six-tenths of those allocated to activity x2 should be at least 50 units.\n- The difference between seven-tenths of the resources allocated to x3 from those allocated to x4 should not exceed 70 units.\n\nEach activity also has its own individual limits on resource allocation: Activity x1 can use no more than 500 units, while activities x2, x3, and x4 can use up to 600, 400, and 300 units respectively. All allocations are required to be whole numbers due to practicalities in managing resources. \n\nGiven these conditions and constraints,\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this supply chain operation given optimal resource allocation within specified bounds? Please provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
