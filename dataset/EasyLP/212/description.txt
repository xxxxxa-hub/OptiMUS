A healthcare manager is planning the allocation of resources among three departments: X, Y, and Z. These could represent different areas like general medicine (X), surgical services (Y), and administrative tasks (Z). Each unit of resource allocated to these departments incurs a cost: 2 units for department X, 3 units for department Y, and 1 unit for department Z. The aim is to minimize the total cost while meeting certain constraints due to staffing levels, operational requirements, or patient needs.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n- The combined resources allocated to departments X and Y must be at least 50 units due to minimum service level requirements.\n- The combined resources allocated to departments X and Z cannot exceed 100 units due to budget restrictions.\n- The difference in resource allocation between departments Y and Z should be at least 10 units, reflecting prioritization towards direct patient care over administration.\n\nGiven that all allocations must be whole numbers because of the indivisible nature of staff hours or other resources involved:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for the healthcare manager given these constraints?
