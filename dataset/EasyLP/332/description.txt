An energy company is planning to invest in four types of power plants: solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear. The investment costs are \$5 million per unit for solar, \$10 million per unit for wind, \$20 million per unit for hydro, and \$30 million per unit for nuclear.\n\nThe company has the following constraints due to its strategic objectives and regulatory requirements:\n- The combined investment in solar and wind power plants must be at least 2000 units.\n- The total investment in hydro and nuclear power plants cannot exceed 5000 units.\n- To maintain a balanced portfolio, the difference between investments in solar and wind power plants should not exceed 1000 units.\n- Similarly, the investment in hydro power plants must be at least 500 units more than that in nuclear power plants.\n\nIn addition to these constraints, there are specific bounds on each type of investment due to practical considerations such as availability of suitable sites or technology limitations. These bounds are as follows: \nsolar <= 3000 units,\nwind <= 2500 units,\n1000 <= hydro <=4000 units,\n1500 <= nuclear <=3500 units. \nThe investments need to be whole numbers because they represent individual power plant projects which cannot be fractionally invested.\nThe question is: What is the minimum total cost (in millions of dollars) that allows the company to meet all these conditions?
