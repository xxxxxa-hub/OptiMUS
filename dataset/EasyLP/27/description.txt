A transportation company has two types of vehicles: type $X$ and type $Y$. The company needs to allocate its vehicles to meet certain demand while minimizing cost. Each vehicle of type $X$ costs $\$4$ per day, and each vehicle of type $Y$ costs $\$5$ per day. Due to road capacity constraints, the combined usage of 2 units of X and 3 units of Y cannot exceed 1000 units per day. To meet the delivery demand, the combined usage of 3 units of X and 2 units of Y must be at least 800 units per day. All quantities are integers due to the indivisible nature of a vehicle.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum daily cost for operating the fleet in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
