An environmental organization is planning a reforestation project and has two types of trees, $X$ and $Y$, to plant. The number of each type of tree planted must be an integer due to the nature of the task. There are constraints on how many trees can be planted: \n\n- The combined total number of $X$ and $Y$ trees cannot exceed 50 due to space limitations.\n- To maintain biodiversity, at least twice as many $X$ trees as $Y$ trees should be planted, with a minimum total for both types being 30.\n- Additionally, there should not be more than 10 more $X$ trees than $Y$ trees planted.\n\nEach type of tree also has different planting costs associated with it. Each $X$ tree costs \$10 to plant and each $Y$ tree costs \$20. The organization aims to minimize these planting costs while adhering to the above constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost for this reforestation project? Provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole number.
