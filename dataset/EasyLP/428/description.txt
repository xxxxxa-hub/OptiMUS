A transportation manager is tasked with optimizing the allocation of resources to two key transport routes, X and Y. The total capacity for both routes combined cannot exceed 2000 units due to existing infrastructure limitations. Route X requires a minimum allocation of 800 units to maintain its operations, while route Y requires at least 500 units. Each unit allocated to routes X and Y incurs costs of \$50 and \$30 respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints, bearing in mind that allocations must be in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of certain resources such as vehicles or staff. What is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
