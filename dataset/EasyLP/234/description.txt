A farmer has a piece of land where he can grow Corn, Wheat, and Soybean. He must decide how many acres to dedicate to each crop in the upcoming season. Each acre of Corn, Wheat, and Soybean yields a profit of $3$, $4$, and $5$ respectively. The farmer must adhere to certain constraints due to the characteristics of the land and market conditions: - The combined acreage for Corn (multiplied by 2) and Wheat (multiplied by 3) cannot exceed 15000 acres, reflecting soil quality or irrigation limitations.- To ensure diversity in his crops, the total acreage across all three crops must be at least 8000 acres.- Additionally, the difference in acreage between Wheat and Soybean should not exceed 2000 acres as part of a risk management strategy.\nGiven these constraints and that the acreages for Corn, Wheat, and Soybean are integers due to the indivisible nature of an acre. What is the minimum total profit that he can expect from this season's harvest if he optimally allocates his land among these three crops? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
