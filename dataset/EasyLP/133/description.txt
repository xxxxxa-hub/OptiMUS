An environmental organization is planning two major projects: Project $X$ and Project $Y$, which aim at reducing the carbon emissions. The total resources for these two projects combined are constrained to a maximum of 1000 units, with every 2 units used in project X and 3 units in project Y. Additionally, to balance the impact of these projects on different sectors, the resource allocated to project X should be at least 100 units more than that of project Y. Each unit of resource in project $X$ yields a cost reduction of $5$, while each unit in project $Y$ yields a reduction of $7$. Given that the organization aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints and ensuring that the resources for both projects are integers due to indivisible nature of resources. What is the minimum total cost possible (in dollars), rounded to nearest dollar?
