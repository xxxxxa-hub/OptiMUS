A manufacturing company produces three products $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total production capacity of the factory limits the combined production quantity to a maximum of 500 units. To meet demand, at least 200 units must be produced from product X twice plus product Y once. Additionally, the combined production of product Y and Z must also be at least 150 units. Production costs per unit for each product are $\$50$ for X, $\$60$ for Y, and $\$20$ for Z respectively.\n\nThe company has constraints on individual production quantities due to resource limitations: a minimum of zero and maximum of 300 units for product X; zero to 200 units for product Y; and zero to 100 units for product Z.\n\nGiven that all these products have to be manufactured in whole numbers due to their physical nature, what is the minimum possible total cost of producing these products while adhering to all given conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
