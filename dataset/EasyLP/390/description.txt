An educational institution is planning to offer four different courses: $x1, x2, x3,$ and $x4$. These courses could be related to different disciplines such as science, arts, technology, and business. The institution has a certain budget that they want to minimize. The cost associated with running each course are as follows: course $x1$ costs 200 units per student, course $x2$ costs 100 units per student, course $x3$ costs 500 units per student, and course $x4$ costs 300 units per student.\n\nThe institution also needs to adhere to the following constraints due to faculty availability and space limitations:\n- The total number of students in courses $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 25.\n- Similarly, the total number of students in courses $x3$ and $x4$ cannot exceed 15.\n- To maintain a balance across disciplines, the number of students taking either course $x1$ or course $x3$, or both should be at least 10.\n- Similarly, the combined enrollment for either course $x2$ or course $x4$, or both should be at least 20.\n\nIn addition to these constraints, each of these courses have specific bounds on their enrollments due to class size restrictions:\n$x1$: [0 - 20]\n$x2$: [0 - 30]\n$x3$: [0 - 15]\n$x4$: [0 - 20].\nThe enrollments must also be whole numbers since it's not possible to have fractional students!\n\nGiven all these conditions, what is the minimum cost for the educational institution when it optimally allocates its resources (students) among these four courses?
