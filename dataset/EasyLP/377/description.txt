A Human Resources manager is planning the allocation of employees across four departments: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These could represent different divisions within the company such as sales, marketing, IT and HR respectively. The objective is to minimize the total salary cost associated with these departments with costs being \$50, \$40, \$30 and \$20 per employee for x1, x2, x3 and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocations must adhere to the following constraints due to manpower requirements and budgetary limitations:- The combined number of employees in department x1 and department x2 must be at least 15.- The combined number of employees in department x2 and department x3 cannot exceed 25.- The number of employees in department x3 must exceed those in department x4 by at least 5.- The difference between the number of employees in department x1 and twice that in department X4 should not exceed 10.\n\nGiven these constraints and the objective function along with a requirement that all allocations are whole numbers (since we can't have fractions of an employee), what is the minimum total salary cost for the company given optimal allocation across departments while keeping within their specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
