A tourism company is planning to allocate resources between two major services: $X$ represents local sightseeing tours and $Y$ represents adventure activities. The total number of services that can be offered in a month cannot exceed 200 due to resource constraints. The minimum number of local sightseeing tours ($X$) they need to offer is at least 50, and for adventure activities ($Y$), it cannot be less than 30. Each service has associated operational costs, with each local sightseeing tour costing $\$300$ and each adventure activity costing $\$500$. The company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints(X, Y are integers). What is the minimum possible monthly operational cost (in dollars) for the company? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.
