A manufacturing company is planning the production of four products: X1, X2, X3, and X4. The costs per unit of these products are \$10, \$12, \$20, and \$15 respectively. The objective is to minimize the total production cost while meeting several constraints.\n\n- The combined quantity for X1 and X2 cannot exceed 1000 units due to raw material limitations.- Twice the quantity of X1 plus the quantity of X3 cannot exceed 1500 units because of machine capacity restrictions.- Three times the quantity of X2 plus twice the quantity of X4 must be at least 1200 units to meet demand requirements.- The difference in quantities between X3 and X4 must not exceed 500 units to maintain a balanced product mix.\n\nMoreover, due to practical considerations in the manufacturing process, all quantities must be whole numbers. Also, each product has specific bounds on its production quantity:\n\n- Product X1: between 0 and 600 units- Product X2: between 0 and 500 units- Product X3: between 0 and 400 units- Product X4: between 0 and 300 units\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost (in dollars) for this manufacturing plan given these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
