An environmental organization is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These projects could involve reforestation, wildlife conservation, pollution control, and climate change research, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects while ensuring that all allocated resources are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being used. The costs per unit of resource for x1, x2, x3, and x4 are 100 units, 150 units, 80 units and 50 units respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints:\n- Three times the resources allocated for project X1 combined with twice those for X2 minus those for X3 cannot exceed 5000 units.\n- The combined resources of four times project X2 plus project X4 minus those from project X1 should be at least 2000 units.\n- The total sum of five times the resources allocated to project X3 minus those from both projects X1 and X2 as well as subtracting the allocation for project X4 has to equal exactly 4000 units.\n- The combination of six times the allocation for Project X2 and seven-and-a-half times that for Project X3 minus both eight-and-a-half times Project X4's allocation and that of Project X1 should not exceed 3000 units.\n\nGiven these conditions along with specific bounds on resource allocations: What is the minimum total cost for carrying out these environmental projects within their specified bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.
