A tourism board is planning to allocate its budget across three major initiatives: X (Promotion of local attractions), Y (Development of tourist infrastructure) and Z (Training for tourism service providers). These initiatives could significantly boost the local economy. The total budget allocated across all three initiatives cannot exceed 5000 units due to financial constraints. Initiative X requires a minimum allocation of 2000 units for a comprehensive promotional campaign, while initiative Y can only receive a maximum allocation of 1000 units due to certain regulatory limitations. Initiative Z necessitates a minimum funding of 500 units, possibly because of the extensive training programs planned.\n\nThe cost per unit effectiveness for initiatives X, Y, and Z are 50 , 100 , and 150 units respectively. The board aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. All allocations need to be in whole numbers as partial fund allocation is not possible.\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost required under these conditions? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
