In a hospital, the manager is trying to optimize the scheduling of nurses and doctors for an upcoming shift. The objective is to minimize the total workload score, which is affected by the assigned hours for each staff member. The workload scores associated with each hour of work are 3 for Nurse1, 2 for Nurse2, 4 for Doctor1, and 5 for Doctor2.\n\nThe following constraints apply to the scheduling:\n- The combined hours of Nurse1 and Nurse2 should be at least 10.- The combined hours of Doctor1 and Doctor2 should be at least 8.- The difference in working hours between Nurse1 and Doctor1 must not exceed 4. This constraint ensures a balanced distribution of workload between nursing and medical staff.- Similarly, the difference in working hours between Nurse2 and Doctor2 must not exceed 3.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total workload score possible? Note that all schedules must be whole numbers due to practicalities.
