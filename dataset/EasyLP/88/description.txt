A company needs to schedule shifts for two groups of workers, $X$ and $Y$. The total hours worked by both groups must satisfy certain constraints due to operational requirements. Specifically, twice the number of hours worked by group X plus three times the number of hours worked by group Y cannot exceed 40 hours. In addition, four times the number of hours worked by group X plus the number of hours worked by group Y must be at least 30 hours.\n\nThe cost per hour for group X is $8 and for group Y is $12. The company aims to minimize its total labor costs while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the scheduled workhours for both groups are integers (due to labor laws or practical considerations).\n\nWhat is the minimum possible total labor cost in dollars under these conditions? Please round your answer to the nearest whole dollar.
