A retail store manager is planning the allocation of resources to four different departments: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These departments could be clothing, electronics, groceries and home decor respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these departments, with costs being \$20 per unit for department x1, \$30 per unit for department x2, \$10 per unit for department x3 and \$15 per unit for department x4.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations:- The combined resource allocation for departments x1 and x2 cannot exceed 1000 units.- The allocation for twice the amount of resources in department x3 plus those in department x4 cannot exceed 800 units.- The allocation of three times as many resources in department x1 and four times as many in department x2 minus those in department x3 must be at least 500 units.- There must be at least as many resources allocated to department x2 as twice the number allocated to department X4.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering that the allocations for each of the departments (x1,x2,x3,x4) are integers due to nature of resource units being indivisible,What is minimum total cost required given optimal distribution within specified bounds? Answer should be rounded off to nearest dollar.
