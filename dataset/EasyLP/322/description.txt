A shipping company needs to distribute packages across three different regions: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The cost of delivering a package to each region is $\$5$, $\$4$, and $\$3$ respectively. Due to transportation constraints, the combined number of packages delivered to regions X and Y cannot exceed 20. To meet customer demand, the total number of packages delivered to regions Y and Z should be at least 30. Furthermore, the difference between the number of packages delivered to regions X and Z must not exceed 10 in order to maintain a balanced service level across all areas.\n\nThe delivery quantities for each region need to be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of packages. Given these conditions, what is the minimum possible total delivery cost while adhering to all constraints? Provide your answer in dollars rounded up to the nearest dollar.
