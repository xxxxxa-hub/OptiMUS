A farmer is planning the allocation of his limited land resources to two crops: Wheat and Corn. Each unit of land (assumed to be an integer value) allocated to Wheat and Corn yield profits of \$5 and \$3 respectively. However, due to the availability of specific farming equipment and manpower constraints, he can allocate a maximum combined total of 1000 units for both crops such that twice the amount for Wheat plus four times the amount for Corn does not exceed this limit. Furthermore, because Wheat tends to bring in higher market prices, he wants to ensure that the land allocated to Wheat exceeds that allocated to Corn by at least 100 units. Given these conditions, what is the minimum profit (in dollars) that the farmer can expect from his crop cultivation plan? Please provide your answer rounded down to the nearest dollar.
