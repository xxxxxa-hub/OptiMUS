A retail manager is planning the inventory levels for two types of products, X and Y. The demand for these products must be met without overstocking due to limited storage space. The minimum combined sales from twice the sales of product X and the sales of product Y should reach 50 units to meet customer demand. However, the combined sales from product X and thrice the sales of product Y should not exceed 150 units to avoid overstocking.\n\nEach unit of product X and Y brings in a profit of \$10 and \$5 respectively, and the manager aims to maximize profits while meeting these constraints. Considering that stock levels can only be whole numbers due to the nature of the products, calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved given these conditions.
