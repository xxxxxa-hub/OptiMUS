A healthcare center is planning to allocate its staff, consisting of doctors and nurses, to two different departments. Each doctor requires 4 hours and each nurse requires 6 hours of work per day. The center has the following constraints: \n\n- The combined hours of work for 2 doctors and 3 nurses must be at least 10 hours, reflecting a minimum service level requirement.\n- The combined hours of work for 5 doctors and a nurse cannot exceed 20 hours, considering the available working time.\n\nGiven that both doctors and nurses can only work in whole numbers due to the nature of their job roles:\nWhat is the minimum total number of working hours required per day if all these conditions are met? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
