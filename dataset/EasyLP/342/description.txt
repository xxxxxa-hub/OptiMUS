A transportation company is planning to allocate its fleet of vehicles across four different routes: x1, x2, x3, and x4. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost associated with these routes, with costs being 10, 9, 11, and 12 units for each vehicle on routes x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to traffic regulations and demand requirements:- The combined number of vehicles on routes x1 and x2 cannot exceed 500.- The combined number of vehicles on routes x3 and x4 cannot exceed 400.- To ensure sufficient coverage of all areas serviced by the company, at least 300 vehicles should be allocated between routes x1 and x3.- Similarly, at least 600 vehicles should be allocated between routes x2 and x4.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering that the number of vehicles assigned to each route must be a whole number (due to the indivisible nature of the resources), along with specific bounds on vehicle allocation for each route:What is the minimum total operating cost for the company in terms of cost units if optimal allocation strategy is followed? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole unit.
