A supply chain manager needs to allocate resources across four different processes: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These could represent steps in the manufacturing, storage, distribution, and transportation of goods. The goal is to minimize the total cost associated with these processes, given their respective costs per unit of resource are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nThe allocation must comply with the following constraints due to logistical limitations and operational requirements:- The combined resources for $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 150 units.- The resources allocated to process $x3$ must be at least 30 units more than those allocated to process $x4$.- Half of the resources allocated to process $x1$ minus three quarters of those allocated to process $x4$ cannot exceed 20 units.- The resources assigned to process $x2$ subtracted from a quarter of those assigned to process $x3$ should be no less than -50 units.\n\nGiven these constraints as well as specific bounds on resource allocation for each project (0 <= x1 <=100; 0 <= x2 <=200; 0 <= x3 <=150; -100 <= x4<=300) , all allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources. What is the minimum total cost for this supply chain management scenario? Give your answer rounded off to nearest integer.
