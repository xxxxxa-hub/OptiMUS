A tour guide is planning to organize tours to four different attractions: x1, x2, x3, and x4. The cost associated with organizing a tour to these attractions are 100, 200, 300 and 400 units respectively. The guide needs to determine the number of tours (in whole numbers) for each attraction that minimizes the total cost while meeting certain constraints:\n\n- The combined number of tours for attractions x1 and x2 cannot exceed 30 due to time limitations.- Twice the number of tours for attraction x3 plus the number of tours for attraction x4 cannot exceed 40 due to vehicle availability.- The total number of tours across attractions x1, x2 and x3 must be at least 20 in order to meet demand.- The difference between the number of tours for attraction x3 and half the number of tours for attraction x4 should not exceed 10 so as not to overload one particular site.\n\nAdditionally, there are individual bounds on how many times each site can be visited: up to 20 times for site X1, up to 15 times for site X2, up to 25 times for site X3 and up to 30 times for site X4.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in units if all these constraints are met? Round your answer off to the nearest whole unit.
