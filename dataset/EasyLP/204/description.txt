In a financial planning scenario, an investor is considering allocating funds across three different investment options: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These options could represent stocks, bonds, or real estate investments. The total funds available for all three investments combined cannot exceed $\$1000$ due to budget constraints. Investment option $X$ requires a minimum investment of $\$300$ to be viable, while investment option $Y$ has a maximum allowable investment of $\$500$ due to risk management considerations. Investment option $Z$, on the other hand, requires a minimum investment of $\$200$, possibly due to its larger scale or higher initial setup costs. Each unit of investment in options $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ yields different returns or costs, quantified as $\$10$, $\$15$, and $\$20$, respectively. The investor aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints (the number of units for each type of investments should be integers). Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario in dollars.
