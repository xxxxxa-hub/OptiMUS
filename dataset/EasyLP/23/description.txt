A manufacturing company is planning the production of two types of products, $X$ and $Y$. The total number of units that can be produced is limited to 200 due to factory capacity. To meet customer demand, the combined output from producing 3 units of product $X$ and 2 units of product $Y$ must be at least 400 units. Each unit of product X and Y costs \$500 and \$300 respectively in terms of raw materials, labor, utilities, etc., and the company aims to minimize these production costs while adhering to these constraints. Since the products cannot be produced in fractions due to their physical nature, both $X$ and $Y$ must be whole numbers. What is the minimum total cost for this operation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
