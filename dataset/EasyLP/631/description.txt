In a sports management scenario, a coach needs to allocate resources across four training groups: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These groups could represent different skills or aspects that the team needs to focus on such as strength conditioning, skill development, strategy planning, and recovery. The fatigue scores associated with each hour of training are 2 for group $x1$, 3 for group $x2$, 4 for group $x3$ and 5 for group $x4$. The coach aims to minimize the total fatigue score while adhering to the following constraints:\n\n- The combined hours of training for groups $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 100 hours.\n- The combined hours of training for groups $x3$ and $x4$ must be at least 50 hours.\n- Twice the number of training hours in group x1 minus those in group x2 should be exactly equal to 30.\n- The difference between half of the training hours in group x4 and those in x3 must not exceed 20.\n\nAdditionally, each group has specific bounds on resource allocation due to facility availability or individual athlete's capacity. For instance, the maximum allowable time dedicated to each skill is set as follows: x1 can't exceed 60 hours; x2 can't exceed 70 hours; x3 can't exceed 80 hours; and x4 can't exceed 90 hours.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of training hours due to scheduling practicalities (i.e., all variables are integers), what is the minimum total fatigue score possible? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest integer.
