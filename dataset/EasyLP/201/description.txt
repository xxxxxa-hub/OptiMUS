In a financial optimization scenario, an investment manager is planning the allocation of funds across three portfolios: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent investments in different asset classes or strategies. The total investment across all three portfolios cannot exceed $\$1000$ due to budget constraints. Also, the combined investment in portfolios $X$ (with a factor of 3) and $Y$ (with a factor of 2), minus the investment in portfolio $Z$, must be at least $\$10$. This might reflect risk-return tradeoffs or diversification requirements. In addition, the difference between the investments in portfolio Z and Y should be no less than $\$30$, which might be due to desired exposure levels to certain types of assets.\n\nEach unit of investment in portfolios X, Y, and Z incurs costs, quantified as $\$5$, $\$6$, and $\$7$, respectively. Portfolio X has a maximum allowable investment limit of $\$500$, while for portfolio Y it is $\$400$. Portfolio Z requires a minimum investment amount of $\$50$. All investments must be made in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of some assets being allocated.\n\nThe question is: Given these conditions, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
