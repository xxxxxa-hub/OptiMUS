A finance manager is planning to allocate a budget between two types of investments: bonds and stocks. The total investment in both cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. The investment in bonds must be at least 200 units more than that in stocks to maintain a conservative risk profile. The costs per unit for bonds and stocks are 10 and 20 units respectively, with the aim of minimizing the total cost while meeting all the investment constraints (Note: The investments in both bonds and stocks should be whole numbers). Given these conditions, what is the minimum total cost of this portfolio allocation strategy? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.
