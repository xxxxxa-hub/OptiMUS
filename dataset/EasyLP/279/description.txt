A tourism agency is planning to allocate tourists among three different tour packages: X, Y, and Z. The total number of tourists cannot exceed 50 due to capacity constraints. Each package has a different cost per tourist, with costs being \$150 for X, \$200 for Y, and \$100 for Z.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints:- The combined number of tourists in packages X (counted as two times), Y (counted as three times) and Z must be at least 60 to ensure minimum operational efficiency.- The difference between the number of tourists in package Y and Z must not exceed 10 to maintain a balanced distribution.\n\nGiven these conditions, all allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of counting individual tourists.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost for the agency, given the optimal allocation of tourists among the three tour packages while meeting all constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
