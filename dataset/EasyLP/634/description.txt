A tourism agency is planning to allocate its resources among four different destinations: x1, x2, x3, and x4. These destinations could represent different countries or cities that the agency plans to promote. The cost associated with promoting each destination differs, being 200 units for x1, 150 units for x2, 100 units for x3, and 50 units for x4.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic considerations:\n- The combined resource allocation for destinations x1 and x2 cannot exceed 300 units.\n- Similarly, the combined resource allocation for destinations x3 and x4 cannot exceed 200 units.\n- To ensure a minimum level of promotion across all regions represented by the destinations, at least 150 units of resources should be allocated collectively to destinations x1 and x3.\n- Likewise, at least 150 units of resources should be allocated collectively to destinations x2 and x4.\n\nGiven these constraints along with the requirement that allocations must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources being used (e.g., advertising slots), what is the minimum total cost in promoting all four travel destinations within their respective bounds? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest unit.
