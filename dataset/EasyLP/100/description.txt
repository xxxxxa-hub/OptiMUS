A human resources manager is planning to allocate employees for two new projects, Project $X$ and Project $Y$. The total number of employees that can be allocated to both projects combined cannot exceed 100 due to limited resources. For the projects to be successfully completed, at least 40 employees must be assigned to Project $X$ and at least 20 must be assigned to Project $Y$. The cost per employee for Project $X$ is $\$50$ and for Project $Y$, it's $\$30$. The HR manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that the number of employees assigned are integers. What is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?
