A construction company is planning to allocate resources between four different types of construction projects: X1, X2, X3 and X4. The cost associated with each type of project per unit is $\$150$, $\$200$, $\$300$, and $\$400$, respectively. The total allocation for projects X1 and X2 cannot exceed 1000 units due to resource limitations, while the combined allocation for projects X3 and X4 cannot exceed 500 units.\n\nIn order to meet their strategic objectives, the effectiveness score calculated as twice the allocation for project X1 plus thrice the allocation for project X2 must be at least 1200 points. Similarly, the effectiveness score calculated as five times the allocation for project X3 plus six times the allocation for project X4 must be at least 2500 points.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering that all allocations must be in whole numbers due to practical considerations like manpower or equipment usage restrictions, what is the minimum total cost in dollars (rounded to nearest dollar) that this construction company will need to bear in order to meet its strategic objectives while minimizing its costs?
