A school is planning to conduct extra classes for two subjects: Math ($X$) and Science ($Y$). The total number of classes combined for both subjects should be at least 50 to meet the curriculum requirements. Additionally, considering the difficulty level and student interest, there should not be more than twice as many Math classes compared to Science classes, with the difference not exceeding 20. Each class for Math costs $4$ units and for Science it costs $3$ units. The school aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of classes are integers due to scheduling practicalities. What would be the minimum total cost required in this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.
