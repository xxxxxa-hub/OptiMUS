A marketing manager is planning the distribution of the budget among three advertising campaigns for an upcoming product launch. The campaigns are identified as $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total budget for all campaigns combined cannot exceed 1000 units due to financial constraints. To meet the campaign's reach and frequency objectives, several conditions must be met:\n\n- The budget allocated to campaign $X$ should not be less than half of that allocated to campaign $Y$.\n- The difference between the budgets allocated to campaigns $Z$ and three-fourths of that allocated to campaign $X$ should not exceed 150 units.\n- Campaign $Y$ should receive at least 50 more units than campaign $Z$.\n\nThe cost per unit effectiveness for each campaign is different, with costs being 100, 200, and 300 units for campaigns X, Y, and Z respectively. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers in allocation due to practicality in monetary terms (each unit represents a certain amount of money), find out how much does it cost to achieve optimal effectiveness?\n\nNote: Each campaign has specific bounds on resource allocation: \nCampaign X: from 0 up to a maximum of 500 units \nCampaign Y: from 0 up to a maximum of 400 units \nCampaign Z: from 0 up to a maximum of 600 units
