A retail store manager is planning to allocate shelf space to two types of products, $X$ and $Y$. Due to the available shelf space, the total number of units for both product types cannot exceed 100. In order to maintain a diverse product offering, the combined number of twice as many units of product $X$ and units of product $Y$ must be at least 50. Each unit of product $X$ yields a profit of \$5 while each unit of product $Y$ yields a profit of \$3. The store manager aims to maximize the total profit while meeting these constraints. Given that each unit represents a whole box due to packing considerations, with the maximum allowable boxes for Product X and Y being 60 and 70 respectively. What is the maximize the total profit? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.
