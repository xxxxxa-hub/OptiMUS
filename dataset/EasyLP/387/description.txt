A tourism company plans to launch four new tour packages: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. The prices of these packages are $\$100$, $\$200$, $\$300$, and $\$400$ respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost of launching these packages.\n\nThe number of resources required for packages $x1$ and $x2$ combined cannot exceed 50 due to limited manpower and facilities. Similarly, the combined resource requirement for packages $x3$ and $x4$ is capped at 80.\n\nTo ensure a minimum level of quality across all packages, certain standards must be met:- The average rating (on a scale from 0 to 1) for packages $x1$ and $x2$, weighted by 0.6 for $x1$ and 0.8 for $x2$, must be at least 20.- Similarly, the average rating for packages $x3$ and $x4$, weighted by 0.7 for package $x3$ and 0.9 for package$x4$, should not fall below 30.\n\nGiven that the number of each package launched must be an integer due to logistical constraints:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar, that can be achieved by optimally allocating resources while meeting all requirements?
