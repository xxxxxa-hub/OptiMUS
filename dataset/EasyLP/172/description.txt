A marketing manager is planning to distribute a total budget of $\$5000$ across three different advertising channels: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These could represent investments in social media advertising, television commercials, and print ads respectively. The distribution should adhere to the following constraints due to strategic decisions, market conditions, or regulatory requirements:- The combined investment in all three channels cannot exceed $\$5000$.- The investment in channel X must be at least $\$1000$ more than that in channel Y.- The difference between the investments in channels Z and Y must not exceed $\$1500$. \n\nThe cost per unit of effectiveness (i.e., reach or impact) differs for each channel: it's $\$50$ for channel X, $\$30$ for channel Y, and $\$20$ for channel Z. The goal is to minimize the total cost while ensuring maximum effectiveness.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that the investments need to be whole numbers due to practical reasons such as contract terms or payment methods:\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this marketing campaign? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
