A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to three different projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, and implementing new technologies, respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being $\$5$, $\$4$, and $\$6$ for project $X$, project $Y$, and project $Z$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget, manpower, and technology limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for twice project $X$, thrice project $Y$ and project $Z$ should be at least 10 units.\n- The allocation for Project X minus Project Y plus Project Z should not exceed 8 units.\n- The allocation for Project Y minus Project Z should be at least 3 units.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function, along with the requirement that the allocations for projects X, Y, and Z must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources. What is the minimum total cost for the company given this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest dollar.
