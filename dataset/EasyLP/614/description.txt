A construction company is planning to allocate resources across four different tasks: $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$. These tasks could represent various stages of the construction process such as site preparation, foundation work, framing, and finishing. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these tasks while meeting all task requirements and constraints. Each unit of resource allocated to tasks $x1, x2, x3$, and $x4$ incurs a cost of 100 dollars, 200 dollars, 300 dollars, and 400 dollars respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following conditions:\n- The combined resources allocated for tasks $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 30 units due to manpower or equipment limitations.\n- Twice the resources allocated for task $x1$ combined with those for task $x3$ should be at least 40 units in order to meet project milestones.\n- The difference in resources between task $x4$ and task $x2$ should exactly equal 20 units possibly due to scheduling or sequential dependencies among these tasks.\n- Task $x1$ along with half of the resources allocated for task $x3$ should not be less than 10 units considering certain quality standards or safety regulations.\n\nGiven that all resource allocations are integers because they may correspond to indivisible items like workers or machines. Also each task has specific bounds on resource allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars for the company given these constraints?
