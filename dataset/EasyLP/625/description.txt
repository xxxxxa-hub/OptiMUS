A supply chain manager is planning the resource allocation for an upcoming production cycle. The resources to be allocated are raw materials, labour hours, production costs (such as machinery operation and maintenance), and transportation costs. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these resources, which are valued at 2 units for raw materials, 3 units for labour hours, 1.5 units for production costs, and 4 units for transportation costs.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations, operational requirements, and contractual obligations:\n- The combined allocation of raw materials and labour hours should meet a minimum threshold of 500 units to ensure sufficient productivity.\n- Production costs cannot exceed half the quantity of raw materials by more than 1000 units due to operational efficiency requirements.\n- Transportation costs should exceed labour hours by at least 200 units reflecting necessary logistics arrangements.\n- Furthermore, there is a balance requirement that the combined amount of raw materials and production costs minus labour hours should be zero. This constraint could reflect a company policy or strategic target related to resource utilization efficiency.\n\nGiven these conditions along with individual bounds on each type of resource (ranging from zero up to certain upper limits) and considering that all allocations need to be whole numbers due to practicality considerations: \nWhat would be the minimal total cost in unit terms given optimal allocation? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.
