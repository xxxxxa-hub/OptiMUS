A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources to two different projects: X and Y. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure (project X) and implementing new technologies (project Y). The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being $50 per unit for project X and $100 per unit for project Y.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget, manpower, and technology limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for both projects cannot exceed 2000 units.\n- The difference between the resource allocation for project X and twice that of project Y should be at least 500 units, reflecting specific project requirements.\n- The resource allocation for Project X should be no less than 750 units, ensuring adequate investment in network infrastructure upgrades.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of resource allocations due to practical reasons. What is the minimum total cost for the company if it optimally allocates its resources within these bounds? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
