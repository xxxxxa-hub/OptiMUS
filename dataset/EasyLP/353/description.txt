In a healthcare setting, a hospital administrator is tasked with allocating resources among four critical areas: nursing staff (nurse), doctors (doctor), medical equipment (equipment), and medicine supplies (medicine). The objective is to minimize the total cost of operations, with costs being 2 units for each nurse, 3 units for each doctor, 4 units for each piece of equipment, and 5 units for each unit of medicine.\n\nThe allocation must meet the following constraints due to budget limitations, manpower availability, and patient care requirements:- The combined number of nurses and doctors should be at least 50 to ensure adequate patient care.- The total number of equipment units and medicine units cannot exceed 100 due to space and storage limitations.- There should be at least 10 more nurses than pieces of equipment to ensure optimal utilization of the available equipment.- The difference in numbers between doctors and medicines should not exceed 20 to maintain an appropriate balance between human resources and material resources.\n\nFurthermore, due to practical considerations related to staffing schedules and inventory management, all allocations need to be whole numbers. And there are also upper limits on the resource allocations due to factors such as regulatory compliance or logistical constraints:\nWhat is the minimum total cost that allows the hospital administrator to meet all these conditions?
